/- Theorem 8.18 is `source-facing`: it is a complexity guarantee for the concrete projected
subgradient iterates generated under Polyak's stepsize rule. The canonical owners already present
in the chapter are the recursive iterate sequence `projected_subgradient_method`, the running-best
objective owner `best_achieved_function_value`, the standing problem assumptions
`IsConstrainedConvexProblem`, the bound package `SubgradientNormBoundOn`, and the pointwise
stepsize rule `polyak_stepsize`. Since `projected_subgradient_method` takes an explicit sequence
`t : ℕ → ℝ`, the Polyak rule is recorded as a trajectory-wise compatibility hypothesis
`h_polyak` rather than by introducing a second state-dependent algorithm wrapper. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply the fundamental inequality from Lemma 8.11 to `xStar ∈ XStar`, then use
-- `h_polyak` to rewrite `t k` as Polyak's quotient and use `h_bound.norm_le` on the chosen
-- subgradient `toDualMap ℝ E (g k (x[k]))` to obtain the one-step decrease
-- `((f (x[k] : E)).toReal - fOpt)^2 / h_bound.L_f^2`. Summing these inequalities telescopes to a
-- bound on the squared objective gaps, and comparing each term with the running minimum
-- `best_achieved_function_value` yields the standard estimate
-- `f_best - fOpt ≤ h_bound.L_f * infDist (x0 : E) XStar / √(k + 1)`. The displayed lower bound on
-- `k` then implies the target `ε`-accuracy bound.
/-- Theorem 8.18: under Assumptions 8.7 and 8.12, if the projected subgradient method uses
Polyak's stepsize rule along the generated trajectory, then every index `k` with
`h_bound.L_f^2 d_{X^*}(x^0)^2 / ε^2 - 1 ≤ k` guarantees that the best objective value attained up
to iteration `k` differs from the optimum by at most `ε`. -/
