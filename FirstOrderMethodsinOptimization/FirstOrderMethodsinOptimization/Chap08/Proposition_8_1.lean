-- Proof sketch: if `x` minimizes the objective, then the value must be `0` by the nonempty
-- intersection hypothesis. Since each set is closed, `Metric.infDist x (S i) = 0` implies
-- `x ∈ S i`, so every minimizer lies in `⋂ i, S i`. Conversely, every point of `⋂ i, S i` has
-- objective value `0`, hence is optimal.

global minimizer set of the pointwise maximum of the distance functions is exactly that
intersection. -/

-- Proof sketch: the nonempty intersection provides a point where the objective equals `0`, so the

-- everywhere, giving the reverse inequality and therefore optimal value `0`.
