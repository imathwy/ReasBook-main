/- Definition 8.2 is `source-facing`: it introduces the unconstrained minimization problem for an
objective `f` on the whole ambient space. The canonical mathlib owner for a global minimizer is
`IsMinOn f Set.univ x`, so this file exposes the corresponding solution-set view instead of adding
a bundled optimization-problem structure or a redundant alias for `f` itself. The Euclidean-space
setup from Definition 8.1 is not semantically active for this owner and is therefore omitted. -/

/-- Definition 8.2: the unconstrained problem `(P)` for an objective `f` is represented by the set
of points that globally minimize `f` on the whole ambient space. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `unconstrained_problem_solutions`; membership in the set is definitionally
-- the statement that the point is a global minimizer of `f`.
/-- A point belongs to the solution set of the unconstrained problem exactly when it globally
minimizes `f`. -/

-- Proof sketch: combine `mem_unconstrained_problem_solutions_iff` with mathlib's

to the value at every other point. -/
