/- Definition 12.9 is a `bridge/view` recall: the orthogonal projection onto an intersection of
closed convex sets is not a new owner abstraction, but the Chapter 3 owner `projectionPoint`
applied to the total intersection.

Domain sampling identifies the canonical owner abstraction and the relevant derived API:
- `projectionPoint` from Proposition 3.12 is the chapter owner of orthogonal projection onto a
  nonempty closed convex set;
- `isClosed_iInter` and `convex_iInter` from mathlib provide the closedness and convexity of the
  total intersection from the family hypotheses;
- `IsMinOn` is the canonical minimizer predicate for the projection problem.

Primitive owner data are only the set `S` together with its nonemptiness, closedness, and
convexity. For an intersection `S = ⋂ i, C i`, the familywise assumptions are auxiliary bridge data
used only to derive `IsClosed S` and `Convex ℝ S`, so the public recall surface stays at the owner
level rather than rebuilding intersection-specific wrappers. -/

/- Definition 12.9: for `S = ⋂ i, C i`, once the total intersection is known to be nonempty,
closed, and convex, its orthogonal projection is the canonical point projection `projectionPoint`
onto `S`, equivalently the optimal solution of `min_x {(1 / 2) ‖x - d‖^2 : x ∈ S}`. -/
