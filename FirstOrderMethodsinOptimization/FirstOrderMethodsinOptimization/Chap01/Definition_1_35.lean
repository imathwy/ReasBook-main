/- Definition 1.35 is recall-only: the Cartesian product of finitely many real inner product
spaces is canonically modeled in Lean by the `L²` product `PiLp (2 : ENNReal) E`. The ambient
vector-space structure is pointwise, and the inner product is the sum of the component inner
products. -/
#check (PiLp (2 : ENNReal) E)

/- Componentwise addition in the Cartesian product is the canonical `PiLp.add_apply` formula. -/
recall PiLp.add_apply

/- Componentwise scalar multiplication in the Cartesian product is the canonical
`PiLp.smul_apply` formula. -/
recall PiLp.smul_apply

/- The inner product on the Cartesian product is the sum of the component inner products. -/
recall PiLp.inner_apply
