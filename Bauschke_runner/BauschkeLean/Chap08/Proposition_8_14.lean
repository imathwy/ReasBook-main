-- Proof sketch: apply `MonotoneOn.convexOn_of_deriv` to the open convex set `I`; differentiability
-- on `I` gives continuity on `I`, and openness identifies `interior I` with `I`.
/-- Proposition 8.14 (1): if the derivative of a real-valued function is increasing on an open
convex subset `I ⊆ ℝ` (the formalization of the textbook's open interval), then the function is
convex on `I`. This is the canonical `ConvexOn` formulation of the textbook Jensen inequality for
the finite restriction of the proper `]-∞,+∞]`-valued function to `I`. -/

-- Proof sketch: use `StrictMonoOn.strictConvexOn_of_deriv` on the open convex set `I`;
-- differentiability on `I` gives continuity on `I`, and openness turns the interior condition into
-- a statement on `I` itself.
/-- Proposition 8.14 (2): if the derivative of a real-valued function is strictly increasing on an
open convex subset `I ⊆ ℝ` (the formalization of the textbook's open interval), then the function
is strictly convex on `I`. This is the canonical `StrictConvexOn` formulation of the textbook's
strict Jensen inequality for the finite restriction of the proper `]-∞,+∞]`-valued function to
`I`. -/
