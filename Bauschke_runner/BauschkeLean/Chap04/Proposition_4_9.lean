/-- Proposition 4.9 (1): a finite convex weighted average of nonexpansive operators on `D` is
nonexpansive. -/
-- Proof sketch: write the difference of the weighted averages as the weighted sum of the
-- differences, apply the triangle inequality, bound each term by nonexpansiveness of `T i`, and
-- use that the nonnegative weights sum to `1`.
