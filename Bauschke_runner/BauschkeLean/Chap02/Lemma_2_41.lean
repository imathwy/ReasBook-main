-- Proof sketch: decompose the continuous affine map `T` as its continuous linear part plus the
-- constant translation by `T 0`; the linear part is weak-to-weak continuous via `WeakSpace.map`,
-- and translation by a fixed vector is a homeomorphism for the weak topology.

topology on the domain to the weak topology on the codomain. -/
