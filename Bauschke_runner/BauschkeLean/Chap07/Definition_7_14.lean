/-- Definition 7.14: the polar set `Cᵒ⊙` of `C` consists of the vectors `u` for which the
inner-product supremum of `C` at `u` is at most `1`, equivalently the lower level set at height
`1` of the support function of `C`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `Set.polarSet`.

`⟪x, u⟫` over `x ∈ C` is at most `1`. -/

-- Proof sketch: use the defining property of `sSup`, noting that the upper bound `1` is
-- equivalent to the pointwise inequalities `⟪x, u⟫ ≤ 1` on `C`.
