Text 1.0.53 (1.33): the source’s notion of lower semicontinuity at a point is the canonical
predicate `LowerSemicontinuousAt`; the textbook’s extended-real-valued case is a specialization of
this mathlib definition.

/-- Text 1.0.53 (1.33), neighborhood form: lower semicontinuity of an extended-real-valued
function at a point is equivalently the condition that every strict lower bound of `f x` remains a
strict lower bound of `f` on some neighborhood of `x`. -/
