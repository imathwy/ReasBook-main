-- Proof sketch: if `g` is a continuous affine minorant of `f`, decompose `g` into its continuous
-- linear part and constant term. Applying the inequality `g ≤ f` to `x` and `-x` yields a two-sided
-- linear bound on `f`, so `f` is bounded above on a neighborhood of `0`; a real linear functional
-- on a normed space that is locally bounded above is continuous, contradicting `hf`.
/-- Example 9.22: a discontinuous real linear functional has no continuous affine minorant. This
specializes the textbook Hilbert-space example, where infinite dimensionality is only used to
guarantee the existence of such a discontinuous functional. -/
