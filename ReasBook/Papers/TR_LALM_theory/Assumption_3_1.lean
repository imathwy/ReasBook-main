/- Assumption 3.1: On the region from `EqualityConstrained.Regularity f c`, a
stochastic first-order oracle supplies a sampled objective, jointly measurable
sample gradients, expectation and unbiased-gradient identities, and uniform
noise and mean-square Lipschitz bounds. -/

/- The companion specification exposes all conditions bundled by the oracle. -/
