Check-only interpretation.

The current repository snapshot still does not contain a checked Chapter 8
owner for the displayed artificial-time diffusion equation
`∂ₜ f = -α • 𝓛(f) f - K⁎ (K f - g)` or a theorem identifying the
lagged-diffusivity right-hand side from Algorithm 8.2.3 with `gradient T`.

Because those source-specific anchors are absent, this file must not invent a
new public ROF/artificial-time-evolution owner or claim that the
lagged-diffusivity clauses from `Book.Ch8.Algorithm_8_2_3.Clauses` are already
exactly `SteepestDescent.iterates`. It therefore keeps the remark as a flat
check-only bridge. The steady-state sentence remains explanatory prose only.

/- Remark 8.2 (1). Main source-facing check-only entry for the displayed
artificial-time diffusion equation
`∂ₜ f = -(α • 𝓛 (f) f) - K⁎ (K f - g)`.

The discrete lagged-diffusivity ingredients already have checked clause owners
in `Book.Ch8.Algorithm_8_2_3.Clauses`, while Exercise 8.4 already provides the
exact fixed-step forward-Euler theorem reused by the remark. What is still
absent is a checked Chapter 8 owner tying those discrete clauses to the
displayed continuous artificial-time diffusion equation, so this file stays as
a thin split `#check` bridge rather than introducing a new theorem or wrapper.

This first `#check` records only the Lean surface of the displayed formula,
with the time derivative, the diffusion operator `𝓛`, the forward operator
`K`, and the adjoint action `K.adjoint` kept as explicit binders. -/

/- Remark 8.2 (2). Source-facing backend check for the fixed-step explicit-time
marching clause after spatial discretization.

Exercise 8.4 already supplies the exact canonical fixed-step forward-Euler
owner. This `#check` records the backend theorem reused by the remark instead
of introducing a new similarity wrapper around Algorithm 8.2.3. -/
