Exercise 7.26 (TSVD L-curve analysis).

This source item asks for a qualitative analysis of the L-curve method for TSVD
regularization using the discussion in `Remark 7.32`. In the current repo
snapshot, that analysis is still blocked at the statement level: there is no
verified Chapter 7 owner for the TSVD discrete-difference L-curve setup, its
auxiliary quantities analogous to `R`, `S`, and `S'`, the corner index `m_L`,
or the mean-square-convergence conclusion mentioned in the remark.

A source-faithful theorem skeleton would therefore have to guess missing
mathematical owners. This file keeps the item in the same check-only blocker
style as `Remark 7.32` and records only the verified canonical anchors that
the eventual formalization should reuse.

/- Exercise 7.26. Main labeled source-facing blocker entry.

The exercise depends on the missing TSVD discrete-difference L-curve owners
identified in `Remark 7.32`, so no faithful theorem statement is introduced
here yet. The `#check` entries below record only the existing base and discrete
TSVD filters, the forward-difference operator, maximizer language, and the
Chapter 7 mean-square-convergence owner that a later source-faithful
formalization should reuse. -/
