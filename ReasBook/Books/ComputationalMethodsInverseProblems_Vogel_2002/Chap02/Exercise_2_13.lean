Refine-stage source-facing blocker for Exercise 2.13.

Exercise 2.13 does not introduce a new negative-Laplacian owner. It asks for
three properties of the exact operator already introduced in `(2.10)`, namely:
* the unit `H¹(Ω) → L²(Ω)` bound on the stated `C¹(Ω)` core
* self-adjointness of that operator restricted to the same core
* positive semidefiniteness of that same restriction

The current repository now has the faithful smooth-core formula layer from
Example 2.5, namely `smoothNegativeLaplacianWithin`, but it still does not
expose the exact domain-local `H¹(Ω)` owner, the corresponding `L²(Ω)`
codomain packaged as the source uses it, or the named `C¹(Ω)` core as a
restricted operator domain. This file therefore remains blocked only on that
extension/restriction layer and reuses the existing Chapter 2 smooth owner
instead of keeping purely generic backend anchors.

Exercise 2.13. Main labeled source-facing blocker entry.

The exact smooth negative-Laplacian formula from `(2.10)` is already owned by
`smoothNegativeLaplacianWithin Ω` and its evaluation lemma. What remains
unresolved here is the source's restriction/extension packaging: the faithful
`H¹(Ω)` domain, the `L²(Ω)` codomain, the `C¹(Ω)` core, and the resulting
operator on that core whose norm, self-adjointness, and positivity are claimed.
