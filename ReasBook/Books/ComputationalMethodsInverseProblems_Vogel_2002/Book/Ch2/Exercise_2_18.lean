Exercise 2.18. Source-facing blocker.

The current workspace exposes the canonical owners `ConvexOn` and
`weakLowerSemicontinuous`, together with the bridge
`weakLowerSemicontinuous_of_lowerSemicontinuousWeakSpace`. However, the
available repository snapshot does not justify the missing extra hypothesis
needed to derive weak lower semicontinuity from bare `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ J`.

In particular, the local mathlib theorem `ConvexOn.continuousOn` is only
available under a finite-dimensional hypothesis, so this file cannot honestly
assert the stronger implication for an arbitrary real Hilbert space. The item
therefore remains blocked until the source confirms the intended additional
assumption.

/- Exercise 2.18. Main labeled source-facing blocker entry.

The source-facing theorem cannot yet be stated faithfully as a proved Lean
declaration, because the current source snapshot omits the additional
hypothesis that turns convexity into a valid weak-lower-semicontinuity
statement. The checks below record the exact canonical owners and bridge that
the eventual repair should reuse, rather than keeping a false local theorem.
