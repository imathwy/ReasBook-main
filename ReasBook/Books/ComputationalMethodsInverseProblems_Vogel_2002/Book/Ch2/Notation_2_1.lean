Notation 2.1-extra-1. This file owns the source-facing `C¹(Ω)` function-space
surface used in Chapter 2, implemented as the set of scalar-valued functions
that are `ContDiffOn ℝ 1` on `Ω`.

/-- Notation 2.1. The source notation `C¹(Ω)` is represented by the set of
real-valued functions on `E` that are `ContDiffOn ℝ 1` on `Ω`. The Chapter 2
uses of this notation are scalar-valued, so this owner keeps the codomain
explicitly fixed to `ℝ` instead of introducing a broader overloaded surface. -/
