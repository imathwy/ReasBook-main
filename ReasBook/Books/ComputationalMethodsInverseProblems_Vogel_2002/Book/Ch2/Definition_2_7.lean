/-- Companion notation for Definition 2.7: the operator equation `K f = g` is well-posed exactly
when `OperatorEquation.WellPosed K` holds, i.e. when every datum has a unique solution and the
inverse response map is continuous. The source clauses about a continuous inverse and ill-posedness
are exposed by the companion facts checked below. -/
