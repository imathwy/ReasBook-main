/- Exercise 2.4. The source asks to show that the adjoint `K*` of the Fredholm
kernel operator `K` from Example 2.4 is given by equation `(2.8)`.

The source-facing theorem is `IsKernelOperator.adjoint_isKernelOperator_swap`,
which states directly that the adjoint of a Fredholm realization again realizes
the swapped kernel. The equality theorem `kernelOperator_adjoint_eq_swap` is the
companion bridge obtained after fixing any realization of the swapped kernel. -/
