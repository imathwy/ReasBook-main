/- Remark 2.35. The left-hand side of (2.38) is the Gateaux, or directional,
derivative of `J` at `f` in the direction `h`, also called the first variation of
`J`; in Lean this quantity is the canonical `lineDeriv ℝ J f h`, often denoted in
the source text by `δJ(f, h)`. The Chapter 2 Hilbert-space specialization used
later in Proposition 2.34 is the repository theorem
`lineDeriv_eq_inner_gradient`. -/
