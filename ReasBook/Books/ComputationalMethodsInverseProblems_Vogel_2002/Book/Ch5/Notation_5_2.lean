/- Notation 5.2-extra-1 (1). The textbook finite complex vector space `ℂ^n`
is represented by the scoped notation `ℂ^[n]`, that is,
`EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin n)`. The Euclidean inner product and induced norm in
equation `(5.16)` are the canonical mathlib formulas checked below. The
textbook component indices `0, ..., n - 1` are realized by `Fin n`.

/- Notation 5.2-extra-1 (2). Complex conjugation is the canonical star
operation on `ℂ`; its ring endomorphism is `starRingEnd ℂ`. The textbook
magnitude `|z| = sqrt (α^2 + β^2)` is Lean's existing norm notation on `ℂ`,
so no new magnitude wrapper is introduced here.

/- Notation 5.2-extra-1 (3). A complex-valued `n_x × n_y` array is represented
by the scoped notation `ℂ^[n_x, n_y]`, that is,
`Matrix (Fin n_x) (Fin n_y) ℂ`. The indices `i = 0, ..., n_x - 1` and
`j = 0, ..., n_y - 1` are realized by `Fin n_x` and `Fin n_y`, and the entry
`f_{ij}` is written in Lean as `f i j`.
