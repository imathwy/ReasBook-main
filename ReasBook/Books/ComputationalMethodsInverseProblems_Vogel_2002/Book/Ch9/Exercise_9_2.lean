/- Exercise 9.2. The source asks for proofs of the two clauses of Theorem 9.7.
Those clauses are already formalized in Chapter 9 as the source-facing theorem
owners below, so this exercise file records direct reuse rather than
introducing an exercise-specific wrapper theorem. -/

/- Exercise 9.2 (1).

The existence-and-uniqueness clause of Theorem 9.7 is formalized by
`existsUniqueMetricProjection`.

#check existsUniqueMetricProjection

/- Exercise 9.2 (2).

The continuity clause of Theorem 9.7 is formalized by
`continuousMetricProjection`.

#check continuousMetricProjection
