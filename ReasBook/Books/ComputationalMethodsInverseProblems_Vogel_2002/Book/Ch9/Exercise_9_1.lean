/-! Exercise 9.1. Statement-stage canonical reuse.

The Chapter 9 likelihood objective `(9.5)` and its displayed gradient and
Hessian formulas `(9.6)`-`(9.8)` are already formalized in the item-local
foundation module `Book.Ch9.Example_9_1.Objectives`. This file stays thin and
source-facing by reusing those existing Chapter 9 anchors directly.

/- Exercise 9.1 (1).

The gradient formula `(9.6)` for the Chapter 9 likelihood objective `J_lhd`
from `(9.5)` is formalized by
`gradient_example91LikelihoodFunctional`.

/- Exercise 9.1 (2).

The diagonal matrix formula `(9.8)` occurring in the Hessian representation is
formalized by `example91LikelihoodDiagonal_def`.

/- Exercise 9.1 (3).

The Hessian formula `(9.7)` using the diagonal matrix from `(9.8)` is
formalized by `hessian_example91LikelihoodFunctional`.
