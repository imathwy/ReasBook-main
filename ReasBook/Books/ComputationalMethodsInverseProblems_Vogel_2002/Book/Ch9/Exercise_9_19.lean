Exercise 9.19.

The source exercise is procedural: apply the MRNSD algorithm to the
two-dimensional test problem from `§9.4.2`. The current repository snapshot
already provides the generic recursive MRNSD iterate owner `Mrnsd.iterates`
together with the companion validity predicate `Mrnsd.IsIterateSequence`, but
it does not yet contain verified Lean declarations for the concrete `§9.4.2`
forward operator, datum, or initialization data. This file therefore records
only the exercise-level specialization shape through direct checks of those
canonical owners, keeping the concrete benchmark objects explicit rather than
inventing unsupported Chapter 9 infrastructure.

/- Exercise 9.19. Apply the MRNSD algorithm to the two-dimensional `§9.4.2`
benchmark.

The repository still lacks the concrete `§9.4.2` benchmark operator, datum,
initial iterate, and boundary-step and step-size policies. The `#check` below
therefore records the intended exercise-level specialization with those
benchmark objects kept explicit at the source-facing API surface. -/
