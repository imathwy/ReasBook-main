Definition 9.2. For a feasible point `f`, the active indices are formalized by
`ActiveSet.active c f = {i | c i f = 0}` and the inactive indices by
`ActiveSet.inactive c f = {i | 0 < c i f}`. The source complement statement is
recorded by `ActiveSet.inactive_eq_compl_active` under the explicit
pointwise-feasibility hypothesis `∀ i, 0 ≤ c i f`.
