Exercise 8.3.

The source exercise concerns the displayed two-dimensional discrete formula
`(8.29)` for `L' (f) f`. The current repository snapshot still does not expose
a chapter-specific owner for the discrete penalty operator `L(f)` or for its
derivative, so this item must not replace that concrete source statement by a
generic public predicate on arbitrary `L'`, `Dx`, `Dy`, and `ψ''`.

Accordingly this file remains a labeled blocker/check-only surface. The checks
below record the existing Chapter 8 Newton owners that a future faithful
formalization of `(8.29)` should connect to directly.

/- Exercise 8.3. Main labeled source-facing blocker entry for the discrete
two-dimensional formula `(8.29)` for `L' (f) f`.

The existing Chapter 8 Newton API already records the penalty-Hessian clause
`H_J := L(f_v) + L' (f_v) (f_v)`, but the book's concrete two-dimensional
discrete operator `L(f)` and its derivative still do not have a source-faithful
owner in the repository. This file therefore keeps the exercise as a
blocker/check-only surface instead of weakening it to an arbitrary matrix
wrapper API.

use should be through the Newton penalty-Hessian accessor below rather than a
