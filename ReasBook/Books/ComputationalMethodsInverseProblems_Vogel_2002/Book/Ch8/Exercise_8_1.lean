Exercise 8.1.

The source asks for two claims about the Chapter 8 matrix `L(f)` from `(8.17)`:
that it is positive semidefinite, and that its null space can be identified
explicitly.

In the current repository snapshot, there is still no checked Chapter 8 owner
for that exact matrix and no checked bridge identifying `(8.17)` with the
verified two-dimensional homogeneous-Neumann owner already available in Chapter
5. This target therefore must remain a source-facing blocker/check-only surface
rather than asserting the exercise on an unverified identification, but its
verified backend anchors should cite the Chapter 5 grid operator directly.

/- Exercise 8.1. Main labeled source-facing blocker entry.

Until the repository exposes a checked Chapter 8 owner for `(8.17)` or a
checked equality identifying that formula with `Matrix.neumannLaplacian`,
the safe statement-stage surface is to keep the source-shaped two-dimensional
grid matrix binder
`L : (Fin n_y × Fin n_x → ℝ) → Matrix (Fin n_y × Fin n_x) (Fin n_y × Fin n_x) ℝ`
explicit and record only the proposition surfaces of the two clauses, together
with the verified Chapter 5 homogeneous-Neumann backend anchors that a later
faithful repair should reuse. -/
