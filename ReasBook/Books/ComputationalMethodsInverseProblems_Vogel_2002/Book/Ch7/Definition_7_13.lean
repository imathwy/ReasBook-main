/- Definition 7.13.

This source item is pure canonical reuse. Lean represents the source limit
notation `α → α*` by an explicit filter parameter `l`, so the source statement
is recovered by specializing to `l = 𝓝 α*`.

The source's asymptotic equality notation is formalized by `f ~[l] g`, since
Lean reserves `≃` for equivalences. Big-O is formalized by `f =O[l] g`. The
checks below record the canonical mathlib owners together with the ratio-to-`1`
bridge `Asymptotics.isEquivalent_iff_tendsto_one`, which assumes the
denominator is eventually nonzero, the quotient-bounded big-O bridge
`Asymptotics.isBigO_iff_div_isBoundedUnder`, which assumes eventual
zero-compatibility `g x = 0 → f x = 0`, and the positive-constant
eventual-bound companion `Asymptotics.isBigO_iff'`. The source `limsup`
wording is kept as explanatory prose only, since no exact verified local
mathlib theorem with that formal statement is introduced here. -/
