/- Exercise 9.4. The source asks for a proof of Proposition 9.8 using
Theorem 2.38, whose formalized owner is
`inner_gradient_sub_nonneg_of_isLocalMinOn`. Proposition 9.8 is already
formalized in Chapter 9 as the three source-facing clause theorems below, so
this exercise file records direct reuse of both that Chapter 2 proof-route
owner and the existing Chapter 9 theorem owners rather than introducing an
exercise-specific wrapper theorem. -/
