/-- Definition 4.3 (1). For a measurable real random variable, the source continuity condition is
the canonical `MeasureTheory.HasPDF` condition, equivalently absolute continuity of the law with
respect to volume. -/

/- Definition 4.3 (1). A real random variable is continuous when its law has a density with
respect to volume; `MeasureTheory.HasPDF` is the canonical owner, and
`Real.hasPDF_iff_of_aemeasurable` gives the absolute-continuity bridge on `ℝ`. -/

formula for the pushed-forward law with the real-line identity
