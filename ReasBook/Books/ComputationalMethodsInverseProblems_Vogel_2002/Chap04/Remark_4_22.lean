/- Remark 4.22. For continuous random vectors `X` and `Y`, the Chapter 4 analogues of
joint and marginal laws, conditioning, and conditional expectation are expressed through
probability densities and conditional distributions. In this setting, the discrete sums in
`(4.9)`-`(4.12)` are replaced by the corresponding integrals, so the source-facing API here
should point directly at the canonical density and conditional-distribution identities rather
than introduce local wrappers. The embedded Table 4.2 is motivational context for the next
proposition rather than a separate owner to formalize here. -/
