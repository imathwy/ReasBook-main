/-- Construction 3.8.3: the universal-cover candidate over a basepoint `b` is the total space of
endpoint-fixed homotopy classes of paths in `B` starting at `b`, indexed by their endpoint. -/

/-- The canonical sigma-point represented by a path has endpoint `f 1`. -/
-- Proof sketch: the first component of `⟨x, mk f⟩` is definitionally `x`, and `Path.target`
-- identifies `x` with `f 1`.
