/-- Lemma 3.1.2: a space is locally path connected exactly when its topology admits a basis
consisting of open path-connected sets. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `X` is locally path connected, use the open path-connected neighborhood basis
-- at each point and `IsTopologicalBasis.of_hasBasis_nhds`; conversely, a topological basis of open
-- path-connected sets yields a neighborhood basis of path-connected neighborhoods via
-- `IsTopologicalBasis.nhds_hasBasis`, giving `LocPathConnectedSpace X`.
