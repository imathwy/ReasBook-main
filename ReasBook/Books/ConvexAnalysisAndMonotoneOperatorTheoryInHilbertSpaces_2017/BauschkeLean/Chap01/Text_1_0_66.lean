canonical filter-theoretic notion `Tendsto u atTop (nhds x)`. -/

Text 1.0.66: in a metric space, convergence to `x` is canonically characterized by
`tendsto_iff_dist_tendsto_zero`; the sequence-at-`atTop` formulation is the textbook
specialization recorded below.

    {f : β → α} {l : Filter β} {a : α} :
    Tendsto f l (nhds a) ↔ Tendsto (fun b ↦ dist (f b) a) l (nhds 0)

/-- In a metric space, a sequence converges to `x` exactly when its distances to `x` tend to `0`.

-- Proof sketch: specialize `tendsto_iff_dist_tendsto_zero` to the filter `atTop` on `ℕ`.
