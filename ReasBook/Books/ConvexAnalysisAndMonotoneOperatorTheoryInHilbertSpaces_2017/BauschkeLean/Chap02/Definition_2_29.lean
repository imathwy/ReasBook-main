/-- Definition 2.29: for a real or complex Hilbert space `E`, the Hilbert space endowed with its
weak topology is the canonical mathlib type `WeakSpace 𝕜 E`, namely `E` equipped with the coarsest
topology making all continuous linear functionals continuous. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the defining induced-topology characterization of `WeakSpace 𝕜 E`; continuity
-- into the weak topology is equivalent to continuity after composing with every weak evaluation
-- map, and these evaluation maps are exactly `x ↦ l x` for `l : WeakDual 𝕜 E`.

/-- For a Hilbert space with its weak topology, each scalar-valued inner-product functional
`x ↦ ⟪x, y⟫` is continuous. -/
-- Proof sketch: transport `x` back to `E` using `(toWeakSpace 𝕜 E).symm`, write the resulting map
-- as scalar conjugation composed with evaluation at `InnerProductSpace.toDual 𝕜 E y`, and then use
-- the defining continuity of evaluations on `WeakSpace 𝕜 E`.

/-- A map into a Hilbert space equipped with its weak topology is continuous exactly when all of
its scalar inner products against fixed vectors are continuous. -/
-- Proof sketch: one direction composes with `weakSpace_continuous_inner_right`; for the converse,
-- recover continuity of all weak evaluation maps via Fréchet-Riesz, expressing each continuous
-- linear functional as `x ↦ conj (⟪x, y⟫)` for a suitable `y`.
