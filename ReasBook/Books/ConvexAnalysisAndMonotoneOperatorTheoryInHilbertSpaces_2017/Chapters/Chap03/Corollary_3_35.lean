/-- Corollary 3.35: a weak limit of points in a closed convex set of a real inner-product space
belongs to the set. -/
-- Proof sketch: `Theorem_3_34` already identifies norm-closed convex sets with weakly closed
-- subsets after transport to `WeakSpace`. Once the weak image of `C` is closed, the limit point
-- lies in that image by closure, and injectivity of `toWeakSpace` pulls the conclusion back to `C`.
