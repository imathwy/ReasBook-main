/-- Text 1.0.44: a net `ξ` converges to `x` exactly when it is eventually contained in every
neighborhood of `x`; in mathlib this convergence is expressed by `Tendsto ξ atTop (nhds x)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: this is the canonical specialization of `tendsto_iff_forall_eventually_mem`
-- to the target filter `nhds x`, together with the tail characterization of `atTop`.
