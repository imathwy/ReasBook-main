/-- Lemma 1.40: if every intersection `C ∩ B[z; n]` with a closed ball of integer radius
`n ≥ 1` centered at `z` is closed, then `C` itself is closed. -/
-- Proof sketch: Use the sequential characterization of closed sets in metric spaces. A sequence
-- in `C` converging in the ambient space is bounded, so it is contained in some
-- `closedBall z n` with `1 ≤ n`; the assumed closedness of `C ∩ closedBall z n`
-- then forces the limit to lie in `C`.
