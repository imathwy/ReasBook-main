/-- Text 1.0.62: a topological space is sequential if and only if every map from it to an
arbitrary topological space is continuous exactly when it is sequentially continuous. -/
-- Proof sketch: For the forward implication, use the existing theorem
-- `continuous_iff_seqContinuous` on a sequential space. For the converse, test the assumed
-- equivalence on the Sierpinski-valued characteristic map of `sᶜ`: sequential closedness of `s`
-- makes this map sequentially continuous, hence continuous, so `sᶜ` is open and `s` is closed.
