-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 7.2 is a recall-only item in the metric / norm-ball domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Metric.closedBall`
- `Metric.mem_closedBall`
- `mem_closedBall_zero_iff`
- `mem_closedBall_iff_norm`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `Metric.closedBall (0 : E) r`
- core/canonical: `Metric.closedBall`
- bridge/view: `mem_closedBall_zero_iff`

Primitive data:
- a seminormed additive group `E`
- a radius `r : ℝ`

Derived API:
- the zero-center membership view `mem_closedBall_zero_iff`

The previous `normBall` and `mem_normBall_iff` declarations were exact-interface duplicates of the
canonical metric closed ball at the origin and its standard norm-bound membership theorem. This
file therefore recalls the canonical owner expression directly instead of keeping a parallel local
wrapper. -/

/- Definition 7.2: the textbook norm ball `B_{‖·‖}(r)` centered at the origin is exactly the
canonical metric closed ball `Metric.closedBall (0 : E) r`. -/

/- Membership in the origin-centered norm ball is exactly the standard norm-bound characterization.

#check (show a ∈ Metric.closedBall (0 : E) r ↔ ‖a‖ ≤ r from mem_closedBall_zero_iff)
