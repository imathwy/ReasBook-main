/-- Definition 7.62: for a strictly positive function `ψ`, its logarithmic transform is
the function `x ↦ ln (ψ x)`. Since `Real.log` is total in mathlib, the owner is the primitive
pointwise map `Real.log ∘ ψ`; positivity remains a source-level hypothesis when needed. -/

/-- The logarithmic transform is exactly composition of `ψ` with the real logarithm. -/
