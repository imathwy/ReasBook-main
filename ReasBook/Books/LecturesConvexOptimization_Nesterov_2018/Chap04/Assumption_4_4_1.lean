/- Assumption 4.4.1 lies in the local first-order smoothness domain for real-valued functions on
feasible subsets of real normed spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* mathlib `DifferentiableOn ℝ f 𝓕`
* mathlib `UniqueDiffOn ℝ 𝓕`
* mathlib `LipschitzOnWith L g 𝓕`
* mathlib `contDiffOn_succ_iff_fderivWithin`
* Chapter 1's whole-space owner pair `ContDiff ℝ 1 f` and `LipschitzWith L (∇ f)` in
  `LecturesConvexOptimization_Nesterov_2018.Chap01.Definition_1_5_2`

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `HasLipschitzDerivativeOnWith L 𝓕 f`
* core/canonical: the primitive triple `DifferentiableOn ℝ f 𝓕`, `UniqueDiffOn ℝ 𝓕`, and
  `LipschitzOnWith L (fun x ↦ fderivWithin ℝ f 𝓕 x) 𝓕`
* bridge/view: on open sets, the ambient-derivative reformulation through `fderiv`; on
  `Set.univ`,
  the whole-space `ContDiff ℝ 1 f`

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `𝓕`
* the objective `f`
* differentiability of `f` on `𝓕`
* unique differentiability of `𝓕`, making the within derivative intrinsic
* the Lipschitz bound for the derivative map `x ↦ fderivWithin ℝ f 𝓕 x` on `𝓕`

Derived API:
* continuity of the within derivative map on `𝓕`
* `ContDiffOn ℝ 1 f 𝓕` on the feasible set
* on open feasible sets, continuity and Lipschitz control for the ambient derivative map
* the whole-space specialization `ContDiff ℝ 1 f` on `Set.univ`

The source statement is genuinely local and on-set, so it should remain a source-facing owner
instead of being collapsed into the Chapter 1 whole-space Hilbert-space owner pair. The refine
work here is therefore to keep that local owner thin on the canonical within-derivative layer,
with the ambient `fderiv` view only as an open-set bridge, not to introduce a parallel wrapper
around already existing global owners.

/-- Assumption 4.4.1: a real-valued function on a subset `𝓕` of a real normed space has a
Lipschitz-continuous derivative with constant `L` when it is differentiable on the uniquely
differentiable feasible set `𝓕` and its canonical within-derivative map
`x ↦ fderivWithin ℝ f 𝓕 x` is `L`-Lipschitz on `𝓕`. On open feasible sets this agrees with the
ambient derivative formulation. -/
