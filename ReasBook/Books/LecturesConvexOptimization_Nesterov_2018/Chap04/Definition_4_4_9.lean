-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 4.4.9 lies in the merit-scalarization / convex-Lipschitz residual domain.

Primary domain:
* sharp residual scalarizations used in merit reformulations of nonlinear equations

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `IsMeritFunction` in `Definition_4_4_1`, the chapter owner for residual scalarizers that are
  nonnegative and vanish exactly at the origin
* `convexOn_univ_norm` in mathlib, the canonical convexity owner for the norm on a real normed
  space
* `lipschitzWith_one_norm'` in mathlib, the canonical `1`-Lipschitz owner for the norm
* `norm_eq_zero` in mathlib, the canonical zero-detection theorem for the norm

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the sharp merit-function property of a residual scalarizer
* core/canonical: `IsMeritFunction` together with the canonical mathlib owners `ConvexOn`,
  `LipschitzWith`, and `‖·‖`
* bridge/view: the textbook specialization to `ℝ^m = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)`

Primitive data:
* a scalarizer `φ : E → ℝ` on a real normed residual space

Derived API:
* the canonical norm example
* the Euclidean `ℝ^m` specialization used downstream in the chapter

This refinement keeps the source-facing owner `IsSharpMeritFunction`, but moves it from the
coordinate model `ℝ^m` to the intrinsic real normed-space layer. The Euclidean residual space
then becomes a direct specialization rather than primitive owner data.

/-- Definition 4.4.9: a sharp merit function on a real normed residual space is a merit
function that is convex, `1`-Lipschitz, and has a sharp minimum at the origin with some constant
in `(0, 1]`. -/

/-- The norm on a real normed residual space is a sharp merit function. -/
-- Proof sketch: `convexOn_univ_norm` and the canonical distance-right `LipschitzWith` owner
-- give convexity and
-- `1`-Lipschitz continuity, while the sharp lower bound holds with `γ = 1`.
