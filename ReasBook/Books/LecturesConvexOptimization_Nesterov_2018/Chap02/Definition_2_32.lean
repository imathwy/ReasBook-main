-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- This item lies in the duality/operator-norm domain for separated source and target seminorms on
finite-dimensional real inner-product-space models, with the textbook `ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ` case treated as a
later Euclidean specialization.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `Seminorm.dualNorm`
* `Seminorm.dualNorm_apply`
* `Seminorm.inner_le_dualNorm_mul`
* `InnerProductSpace.toDual`
* `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm`, the canonical ambient-norm owner for operator norms on continuous
  linear maps
* `operatorNorm_eq_sSup_dualPairing_unitSpheres` in `Chap06/Definition_6_3`
* `hessianOperatorToDual` in `Chap04/Text_4_2_3`, the project's intrinsic dual-valued operator
  owner
* `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`, the canonical bridge from matrices to owner linear maps

Owner abstraction:
* `Seminorm.primalDualOperatorNorm p d A` for `A : E →ₗ[ℝ] StrongDual ℝ F`

Primitive data:
* a source seminorm `p`
* a target seminorm `d`
* a linear map `A : E →ₗ[ℝ] StrongDual ℝ F`
* a finite-dimensional real normed-space structure on the source `E`
* the source-side separation hypothesis `[Seminorm.IsNorm p]`
* a finite-dimensional real inner-product-space structure on `F`
* the target-side separation hypothesis `[Seminorm.IsNorm d]`, needed for the transported dual
  norm on `StrongDual ℝ F`

Derived API:
* the defining supremum formula over the primal unit ball
* the two-ball dual-pairing formula
* the Euclidean bridge `A : E →ₗ[ℝ] F ↦ (InnerProductSpace.toDual ℝ F).toLinearMap.comp A`
* the ambient-norm companion owner `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm` only in the special case where `p`
  and `d` are the ambient norms
* the finite-dimensional matrix realization via `A.toEuclideanLin`, composed with `toDual`, as a
  bridge/view, not as a second public owner

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook induced operator norm with source seminorm `p` and target dual norm
  `d*` on the finite-dimensional source/target setting where the displayed real supremum is honest
* core/canonical: the same owner on dual-valued maps `E →ₗ[ℝ] StrongDual ℝ F`
* bridge/view: the `F`-valued Euclidean realization obtained by composing with
  `InnerProductSpace.toDual`, together with the ambient-norm specialization to
  `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm`

computed as the supremum of the transported `d*`-norm over the primal closed unit ball. The owner
