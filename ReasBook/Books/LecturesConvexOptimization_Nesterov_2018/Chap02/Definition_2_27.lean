-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 2.27 is a recall-only item in the Euclidean convex-geometry domain of the
nonnegative first-coordinate ray in `ℝ²`.

Primary domain:
- convex-geometric subsets of `ℝ²` presented by coordinate conditions.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay`, the chapter's canonical owner for `ℝ_+^{1,2}`;
- `mem_nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay_iff`, the derived coordinate membership criterion;
- `Set.prod`, the canonical product-set owner used to form coordinate-axis subsets;
- `Ici`, the canonical half-line owner for the nonnegative first coordinate.

Best owner abstraction:
- `nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay : Set (ℝ × ℝ)`

Primitive data:
- the first-coordinate half-line `Ici (0 : ℝ)`;
- the second-coordinate singleton `{(0 : ℝ)}`;
- their product-set realization `Ici (0 : ℝ) ×ˢ ({(0 : ℝ)} : Set ℝ)`.

Derived API:
- `mem_nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay_iff`, which rewrites membership in the owner set as
  `0 ≤ x.1 ∧ x.2 = 0`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook ray `ℝ_+^{1,2}`;
- core/canonical: `nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay`;
- bridge/view: `mem_nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay_iff`.

This file therefore recalls the upstream owner declaration directly and introduces no parallel
local definition such as `nonnegativeFirstCoordinateAxis`.
