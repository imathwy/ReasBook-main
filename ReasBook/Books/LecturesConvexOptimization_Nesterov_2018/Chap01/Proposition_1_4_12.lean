Proposition 1.4.12 is `source-facing` in first-order smooth optimization.

Primary domain:
* directional derivatives on a real Hilbert space, minimized over the unit sphere.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `HasDerivWithinAt (fun α : ℝ ↦ f (xBar + α • s)) Δ (Set.Ici (0 : ℝ)) 0`
* `lineDeriv ℝ f xBar s`
* `DifferentiableAt.lineDeriv_eq_fderiv`
* `inner_gradient_left`
* `IsMinOn`

Owner abstraction:
* the directional-derivative owner `lineDeriv ℝ f xBar`
* represented, under differentiability, by the gradient vector `∇ f xBar`

Primitive data:
* a differentiable function `f`
* a base point `xBar`

Derived API:
* the lower bound for `lineDeriv ℝ f xBar` on the unit sphere
* the attained value at `-normalize (∇ f xBar)`
* the source-facing minimizer statement on the unit sphere

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: minimizing the directional derivative over unit directions
* core/canonical: `lineDeriv ℝ f xBar`, `gradient`, `normalize`, `Metric.sphere`, and `IsMinOn`
* bridge/view: `DifferentiableAt.lineDeriv_eq_fderiv` and `inner_gradient_left`

Definition 1.4.11 already fixed the chapter owner for directional derivatives. This file therefore
keeps `lineDeriv` on the public theorem surface and uses `fderiv ℝ f xBar s` only through the
canonical differentiability bridge, not as a second owner for the same notion.

/-- Proposition 1.4.12: if the gradient at `xBar` is nonzero, then the minimum directional
derivative on the unit sphere is attained at the normalized negative gradient direction.
Concretely, `-normalize (∇ f xBar)` lies on the unit sphere and minimizes `lineDeriv ℝ f xBar`
there. The companion lemmas
`lineDeriv_ge_neg_norm_of_mem_unitSphere` and
`lineDeriv_neg_normalize_gradient_eq_neg_norm` isolate the lower-bound and value computations. -/
-- Proof sketch: first derive `DifferentiableAt ℝ f xBar` from `hgrad` using
-- `gradient_eq_zero_of_not_differentiableAt`. The nonzero-gradient hypothesis then puts
-- `-normalize (∇ f xBar)` on the unit sphere by `norm_normalize`. The value clause is
-- `lineDeriv_neg_normalize_gradient_eq_neg_norm`. For minimality, combine that equality with
-- `lineDeriv_ge_neg_norm_of_mem_unitSphere` and rewrite the result using `isMinOn_iff`.
