/- Definition 1.10.15 lies in the chapter's penalty-function domain for finitely many continuous
inequality constraints.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
* `IsPenaltyFunction` in `Definition_1_10_14`
* `constraintSet` in `Proposition_1_10_17`, the chapter's finite-family feasible-set owner
* `PosPart.posPart` together with `posPart_def`
* the canonical ring structure on `C(X, ℝ)`, including pointwise sums and powers
* the pointwise order/lattice structure on `C(X, ℝ)`

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the two explicit penalty maps attached to a finite constraint family
* core/canonical: the bundled continuous maps `C(X, ℝ)` together with `IsPenaltyFunction`
* bridge/view: the pointwise evaluation formulas recovering the textbook sums of positive parts

Primitive data:
* a finite family `constraints : ι → C(X, ℝ)` with `[Fintype ι]`

Derived API:
* the feasible-set owner `constraintSet constraints`
* the quadratic and nonsmooth penalty maps
* their pointwise formulas and their certification as penalty functions

The Euclidean model `ℝⁿ` is not used by the constructions themselves, so the owner declarations are
kept at the weaker canonical level of an arbitrary topological space with real-valued continuous
constraints. -/

variable [Fintype ι] (constraints : ι → C(X, ℝ))

/-- Definition 1.10.15: for continuous constraint functions `f₁, …, f_m : ℝⁿ → ℝ`, the feasible
set `constraintSet constraints` is cut out by the inequalities `constraints j x ≤ 0`, and one
quadratic penalty for it is
`x ↦ ∑ j, ((fⱼ x)⁺)^2`, where `a⁺ = max a 0` is mathlib's positive-part notation. The nonsmooth
penalty is introduced below as a companion definition. -/
def quadraticPenalty : C(X, ℝ) :=
  ∑ j : ι, ((constraints j)⁺) ^ (2 : ℕ)

@[simp] theorem quadraticPenalty_apply (x : X) :
    quadraticPenalty constraints x = ∑ j : ι, ((constraints j x)⁺) ^ (2 : ℕ) := by
  simp [quadraticPenalty, posPart_def]

/-- The nonsmooth penalty associated to finitely many continuous inequality constraints is the sum
of the positive parts of the constraint violations. -/
def nonsmoothPenalty : C(X, ℝ) :=
  ∑ j : ι, (constraints j)⁺

@[simp] theorem nonsmoothPenalty_apply (x : X) :
    nonsmoothPenalty constraints x = ∑ j : ι, (constraints j x)⁺ := by
  simp [nonsmoothPenalty, posPart_def]

/-- The quadratic penalty is a penalty function for the feasible set cut out by the given
continuous inequality constraints. -/
-- Proof sketch: continuity follows from continuity of each constraint, the positive-part map, the
-- squaring map, and finite sums. On the feasible set every positive part vanishes; outside the
-- feasible set some constraint is positive, so the corresponding summand is strictly positive.

/-- The nonsmooth penalty is a penalty function for the feasible set cut out by the given
continuous inequality constraints. -/
-- Proof sketch: use continuity of the positive-part map and finite sums. Feasible points make
-- every positive part vanish, while an infeasible point has at least one violated constraint whose
-- positive part contributes a strictly positive summand.
