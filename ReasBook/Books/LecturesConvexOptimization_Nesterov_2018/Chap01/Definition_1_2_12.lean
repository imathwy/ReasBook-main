variable {Query : Type u} {Answer : Type v}

/- Primary domain: arithmetic complexity of information-set-based black-box iterative schemes.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `GeneralIterativeScheme` and `GeneralIterativeScheme.HaltsAt` in
  `Algorithm_1_2_10.lean`, which supply the source-facing informational-state dynamics and halting
  predicate;
* `GeneralIterativeScheme.IsAnalyticalComplexity` in `Definition_1_2_11.lean`, the source-facing
  analytical-complexity predicate;
* `GeneralIterativeScheme.isAnalyticalComplexity_iff` in `Definition_1_2_11.lean`, the chapter
  bridge to the textbook “halts first at `N`” phrasing;
* `IsLeast` in mathlib `Order.Bounds.Defs`, the canonical least-element predicate used internally
  by `IsAnalyticalComplexity`.

Owner abstraction:
the pair consisting of the informational-state owner object `GeneralIterativeScheme` and the
source-facing analytical-complexity witness `scheme.IsAnalyticalComplexity N`.

Primitive data:
the scheme together with the per-call oracle work `oracleWork` and informational-state update work
`methodWork`.

Derived API:
the per-iteration and cumulative arithmetic work, and the source-facing predicate saying that
`M` is the total arithmetic work at the least halting iteration. -/
