/- Primary domain: barrier predicates for continuous real-valued functions on the interior of a
closed subset of a topological space.

Sampled owner-style declarations in the same domain:
* `C(interior 𝓕, ℝ)`, the canonical owner for continuous maps on the intrinsic domain;
* `TopologicalSpace.Closeds α`, the canonical mathlib owner for closed subsets;
* `liftedConeLogSumExpBarrier_restriction_isBarrierFunctionOn` in `Chap05/Theorem_5_4_7_7`,
  which expresses the same frontier growth condition after passing to the normalization-hyperplane
  relative ambient space;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith dom ν F` in `Chap05/Definition_5_3_2`, which keeps the owner
  function central and pushes auxiliary assumptions into parent structure data.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `IsBarrierFunctionOn 𝓕 F`;
* core/canonical: the bundled owner map `F : C(interior 𝓕, ℝ)`;
* bridge/view: the closed-set hypothesis should be carried canonically as a parent assumption,
  not repeated as a bespoke field, while the interior nonemptiness and frontier-divergence data
  remain part of the source-facing notion.

Primitive data:
* `Fact (IsClosed 𝓕)`;
* `(interior 𝓕).Nonempty`;
* the frontier growth condition for the owner map.

Derived API:
* `hF.isClosed : IsClosed 𝓕`;
* `hF.interior_ne_empty : interior 𝓕 ≠ ∅`. -/

/-- Definition 1.10.18: a barrier function for `𝓕` is a bundled continuous map
`F : C(interior 𝓕, ℝ)` on the interior of a closed set `𝓕` with nonempty interior, such that the
values of `F` along every sequence in `interior 𝓕` converging to a boundary point of `𝓕` tend to
`+∞`. The owner object is the continuous map on `interior 𝓕`; the closedness and nonempty-interior
hypotheses remain part of the public predicate because they are part of the textbook notion. -/
