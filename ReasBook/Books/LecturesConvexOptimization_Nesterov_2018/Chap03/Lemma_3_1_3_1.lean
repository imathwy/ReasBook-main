/- Lemma 3.1.3.1 is source-facing in the chapter's convex directional-derivative domain.

Primary domain:
- finite directional derivatives of convex `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions at interior points.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `convexDirectionalDerivative` in `Theorem_3_21`, the chapter owner for the extended-valued
  directional derivative at a finite base point;
- `convexDirectionalDerivativeReal_convexOn_univ_of_mem_interior` in `Theorem_3_21`, the owner
  convexity theorem for the theorem-level finite directional-derivative view on all directions;
- `withTopEffectiveDomain`, `withTopRealPart`, and
  `ConvexOn ℝ (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)` in `Definition_3_3`;
- `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn` in `Definition_3_1_7`, the chapter owner for positive homogeneity.

Best owner abstraction:
- the theorem-level finite `toReal` view of the chapter owner
  `convexDirectionalDerivative f x (interior_subset hx)`, identified upstream with
  `HasDirectionalDerivAt`.

Primitive data:
- none in this file; the secant-slope and `EReal` infimum construction are already owned upstream
  by `Theorem_3_21`.

Derived API:
- the owner-level convexity recall on all directions;
- the positive-homogeneity theorem for the finite directional-derivative owner;
- the affine-support inequality in real form on the same topological-module owner layer.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the real-valued directional derivative at an interior point, together with its
  convexity, degree-one positive homogeneity, and affine support inequality;
- core/canonical: `convexDirectionalDerivative` and `HasDirectionalDerivAt`;
- bridge/view: the upstream direct `toReal` expansion against
  `convexDirectionalDerivative f x (interior_subset hx)`.

This file therefore stops re-owning the directional derivative as a global real-valued definition.
The `EReal` infimum-of-slopes object remains the upstream core owner, while the public surface
here uses only the explicit theorem-level finite view supplied by the chapter
directional-derivative API. The convexity, positive-homogeneity, and affine-support surface all
live in the same topological-module layer.
