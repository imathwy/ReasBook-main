/- Theorem 3.20 is a recall-only Euclidean specialization in the chapter's Fenchel-biconjugacy
domain.

Primary domain:
- Fenchel conjugates, biduals, and subdifferentials of `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions on `ℝⁿ`.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `fenchelConjugate` in `Definition_6_1`, the core owner;
- the source-facing Fenchel-dual notation `f⋆` in `Definition_3_1_2_1`;
- the source-facing Fenchel-bidual notation `f⋆⋆` in `Theorem_3_1_5_2`;
- the intrinsic theorem declarations `fenchelBidual_le_of_mem_dom`,
  `subdifferential_subset_dom_fenchelDual`, and
  `fenchelBidual_eq_of_subdifferential_nonempty` in `Theorem_3_1_5_2`.

Best owner abstraction:
- the intrinsic theorem surface in `Theorem_3_1_5_2`, stated on the chapter's source-facing
  notation `f⋆` and `f⋆⋆`.

Primitive data:
- none in this file; the notation and theorem owners already live upstream.

Derived API:
- this Euclidean recall surface.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Theorem 3.20's Euclidean `ℝⁿ` specialization of the textbook Fenchel-biconjugacy
  statements;
- core/canonical: the intrinsic theorem declarations from `Theorem_3_1_5_2`;
- bridge/view: this finite-dimensional specialization by recall.

The previous refinement rebuilt a parallel Euclidean `f⋆` / `f⋆⋆` surface locally and then only
`#check`ed the theorem propositions. This file now consumes the owner-level notation and theorem
API from `Definition_3_1_2_1` and `Theorem_3_1_5_2` directly, so the Euclidean item is only the
specialization layer and does not maintain a second bridge surface. The explicit specialized
checks below expose the actual `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` signatures instead of only
rechecking the generic owner names.
