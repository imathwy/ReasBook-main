Definition 3.1.3.1 is source-facing in the chapter's one-sided directional-derivative API.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- mathlib `HasDerivWithinAt`
- mathlib `HasLineDerivWithinAt`
- mathlib `LineDifferentiableWithinAt`
- chapter `hasDerivWithinAt_directionalSlice_of_differentiableAt` in
  `LecturesConvexOptimization_Nesterov_2018.Chap01.Definition_1_4_11`
- chapter notation `dom f` for the effective domain owner in
  `LecturesConvexOptimization_Nesterov_2018.Chap03.Definition_3_1_1_2`

Best owner abstraction:
- the one-variable right derivative
  `HasDerivWithinAt (fun α ↦ extendedRealRealPart f (x + α • p)) d (Ici (0 : ℝ)) 0`

Primitive data:
- the finite base-point condition `x ∈ dom f`
- eventual finiteness of the ray `α ↦ x + α • p` for `α ↓ 0`
- the owner derivative of the finite real slice on `Ici 0`

Derived API:
- `DirectionallyDifferentiableAt`
- the accessor lemmas on `HasDirectionalDerivAt`
- uniqueness of the finite directional derivative
- the zero-direction specialization

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `HasDirectionalDerivAt`, `DirectionallyDifferentiableAt`
- core/canonical: `HasDerivWithinAt` on the directional slice
- bridge/view: the existential wrapper
  `directionallyDifferentiableAt_iff_exists_hasDirectionalDerivAt`

The more general line-derivative owner `HasLineDerivWithinAt` is not used as the main entry here:
the textbook notion is explicitly one-sided (`α ↓ 0`), so `HasDerivWithinAt ... (Ici 0) 0` is the
faithful core, while the extra finiteness hypotheses stay as source-facing domain guards.

As in earlier chapter owner files, the source prose is written on `ℝⁿ`, but these declarations use
only the additive and scalar-action structure needed to form the ray `x + α • p`. The ambient
owner therefore lives over an arbitrary real module instead of the concrete Euclidean model.

/-- Definition 3.1.3.1: an extended-real-valued function has directional derivative `d` at
`x` in direction `p` when `x` has finite value, the nearby values along the ray `x + α • p`
are finite for `α ↓ 0`, and the directional slice
`α ↦ extendedRealRealPart f (x + α • p)` has right derivative `d` at `0`. This includes the zero
direction, whose ray is constant and whose derivative is therefore `0`. -/
