Definition 3.1.1.1 lies in the convex constrained minimization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `withTopEffectiveDomain`, `withTopRealPart`, and `constrainedEpigraph` in `Definition_3_3`, the
  earlier chapter owner layer for `WithTop`-valued convex-analysis data and its canonical
  epigraph bridge;
- `GeneralMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_1_3`, the earlier project owner for a
  feasible set together with finitely many scalar constraints on a subtype;
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the earlier project owner for
  the ambient feasible set and real-valued objective layer of a constrained problem;
- `ConvexInequalityConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap05/Definition_5_0_1`, the later
  whole-space real-valued convex inequality owner.

Best owner abstraction:
- `GeneralConvexMinimizationProblem X m` for the source-facing constrained minimization problem on
  a real ambient space `X`;
- `Definition_3_3` remains the owner for the ambient `WithTop` epigraph bridge;
- the textbook `ℝⁿ` formulation is a specialization of this owner, not its primitive core.

Primitive data:
- `feasibleSet`
- `objective`
- `constraints`
- the closedness and convexity witnesses.

Derived API:
- the coercion to the ambient objective function;
- the real-valued bridge `ofReal`, which reuses the Chapter 1 owner
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` for the feasible-set / objective layer;
- `GeneralConvexMinimizationProblem.IsFeasible` and its atomic consequence lemmas.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook general convex minimization problem with convex inequality
  constraints;
- core/canonical: `GeneralConvexMinimizationProblem X m`;
- bridge/view: the textbook Euclidean specialization `X = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, together
  with the coercion to the ambient objective function and the feasibility lemmas; the ambient
  epigraph bridge is reused from `Definition_3_3`.

This file therefore keeps the chapter owner abstraction and does not collapse it to the earlier
Chapter 1 owners, whose objective and constraint data live on a subtype and in `ℝ` rather than as
ambient `WithTop ℝ` convex functions.

/-- Definition 3.1.1.1, generalized from the textbook `ℝⁿ` setting: a general convex
minimization problem consists of minimizing an ambient extended-real-valued convex objective
function over a closed convex set `Q ⊆ X`, subject to finitely many ambient extended-real-valued
convex inequality constraints `fᵢ(x) ≤ 0`; no differentiability is assumed for the objective or
constraint functions. -/
