Definition 3.9 is the source-facing owner declaration in the chapter's support-function domain.

Primary domain:
- support functions of subsets of a real inner-product space.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `pointwiseSupremumOn` in `PointwiseSupremumOn`, the generic subset-indexed supremum owner
- `pointwiseSupremumOn_apply` in `PointwiseSupremumOn`, the evaluation bridge for that owner
- downstream recall `Definition_3_1_2_2`
- downstream proposition file `Proposition_3_1_2_2`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the chapter declaration `supportFunction`
- core/canonical: `pointwiseSupremumOn`

Primitive data:
- a set `Q : Set E`

Derived API:
- the evaluation lemma `supportFunction_apply`
- the convex-hull invariance theorem `supportFunction_convexHull_eq`
- later support-function results such as positive homogeneity and effective-domain theorems

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook support function of a set
- core/canonical: `pointwiseSupremumOn`; no more intrinsic mathlib owner for this exact
  `EReal`-valued Euclidean support-function specialization was found in the sampled domain
- bridge/view: the defining evaluation lemma `supportFunction_apply`

/-- Definition 3.9: for a set `Q ⊆ ℝⁿ`, the support function of `Q` is the extended-real-valued
function sending `x` to the supremum of the inner products `⟪g, x⟫` over `g ∈ Q`. The textbook
`ℝⁿ` statement is the specialization `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. -/
