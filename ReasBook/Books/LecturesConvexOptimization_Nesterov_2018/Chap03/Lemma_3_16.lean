/- Lemma 3.16 is a source-facing bounded-to-compact bridge in the chapter's
support-function-composition domain.

Primary domain:
- support-function compositions and their active-multiplier subdifferentials.

Sampled owner and bridge declarations:
- `activeSupportFunctionMultipliers`
- `subdifferential_supportFunction_comp_vectorMap_eq_image_activeMultipliers`
- `Bornology.IsBounded.isCompact_closure`
- `subset_convexHull`

Best owner abstraction:
- the owner theorem
  `subdifferential_supportFunction_comp_vectorMap_eq_image_activeMultipliers`
  over the support-function composition `x ↦ ξ[Λ] (vectorMap fs x)`, its active multipliers
  `activeSupportFunctionMultipliers Λ fs x`, its thin `WithTop` bridge
  `supportFunctionCompWithTop Λ fs`, and `weightedGradientCombination`

Primitive data:
- a weight set `Λ : Set Eₘ`
- a coordinate family `fs : Fin m → E → ℝ`
- a pointwise gradient witness `HasGradientAt (fs i) (∇ (fs i) x) x` at the base point

Derived API kept here:
- the source-facing orthant hypothesis `Λ ⊆ nonnegativeOrthant m`
- the bounded-to-compact passage `Bornology.IsBounded.isCompact_closure`
- the closure active multiplier face `activeSupportFunctionMultipliers (closure Λ) fs x`
- the convex-hull enclosure `subset_convexHull`
- the direct image `(weightedGradientCombination fs x) ''
    activeSupportFunctionMultipliers (closure Λ) fs x`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Lemma 3.16's bounded-to-compact subdifferential description
- core/canonical: `EuclideanSpace.nonnegativeOrthant`, `supportFunction`, `pointwiseSupremumOn`,
  `weightedGradientCombination`, `subdifferential`,
  `subdifferential_supportFunction_comp_vectorMap_eq_image_activeMultipliers`
- bridge/view: `Bornology.IsBounded.isCompact_closure`, the closure specialization, and the
  `WithTop` bridge `supportFunctionCompWithTop Λ fs` on the left-hand side of the theorem
  statements

This file therefore refines part (1) to direct canonical recall of the exact owner theorem
`convexOn_supportFunction_comp_vectorMap` and keeps only parts (2) and (3) as the genuine
bounded-to-compact bridge layer on top of that owner API.

/- Lemma 3.16 (1): for a nonnegative weight set, the finite real part of the
support-function composition `x ↦ ξ[Λ] (vectorMap fs x)` is convex on its effective domain.

This is exactly the upstream owner theorem `convexOn_supportFunction_comp_vectorMap` from
`Lemma_3_1_16`. In the bounded case considered here, Proposition 3.11 can additionally identify
that effective domain with `Set.univ`. Keeping a renamed local theorem here would duplicate the
owner's exact interface, so this file records that fact only in prose. -/
