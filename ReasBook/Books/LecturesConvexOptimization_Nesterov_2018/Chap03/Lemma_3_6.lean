Lemma 3.6 lies in the chapter's extended-valued constrained-subdifferential domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `∂[Q] f(x)` / `constrainedSubdifferential` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the source-facing local
  subgradient owner;
- `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the atomic membership bridge;
- `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the canonical finite-valued representative on the
  effective domain;
- `ClosedConvexOn` in `Definition_3_1_1_5`, a downstream bridge that packages convexity,
  lower-semicontinuity, and finiteness into epigraph language when extra closedness is available.

Best owner abstraction:
- the constrained-subdifferential owner `∂[Q] f(x)` together with the canonical conclusion
  surfaces `ConvexOn ℝ Q (withTopRealPart f)` and
  `LowerSemicontinuousOn (withTopRealPart f) Q`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q`;
- the `WithTop ℝ`-valued objective `f`;
- pointwise nonemptiness of `∂[Q] f(x)` on `Q`;
- convexity of `Q`, needed only for the convexity conclusion.

Derived API:
- `convexOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty`;
- `lowerSemicontinuousOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Lemma 3.6's convexity and lower-semicontinuity consequences;
- core/canonical: `constrainedSubdifferential`, `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`, and
  `withTopRealPart`;
- bridge/view: downstream repackaging into `ClosedConvexOn`.

The owner abstraction here is the constrained subdifferential itself, not a wrapper around its
epigraph consequences. Since the lower-semicontinuity proof uses only the supporting affine
minorant at each base point, convexity of `Q` is redundant for that second theorem and is removed
from its public API; only the convexity theorem keeps the convexity hypothesis.

/-- Helper for Lemma 3.6: a constrained subgradient at `x` produces a continuous affine minorant,
so `withTopRealPart f` is lower semicontinuous within `Q` at `x`. -/
-- Proof sketch: compare `withTopRealPart f` to the affine function
-- `z ↦ withTopRealPart f x + ⟪g, z - x⟫`, which agrees with `withTopRealPart f x` at `x` and is
-- continuous. The subgradient inequality keeps `withTopRealPart f` above this affine minorant on

/-- Lemma 3.6 (1), generalized from the textbook `ℝⁿ` setting: if `Q` is convex and every
constrained subdifferential `∂_Q f(x)` with `x ∈ Q` is nonempty, then the finite-valued
representative of `f` is convex on `Q`. The
nonemptiness hypothesis already forces `f` to be finite on `Q`. -/
-- Proof sketch: fix `x₀, x₁ ∈ Q` and `θ ∈ [0, 1]`, and set `xθ = (1 - θ) • x₀ + θ • x₁`. Choose
-- `g ∈ ∂_Q f(xθ)`, apply the subgradient inequality to `y = x₀` and `y = x₁`, weight the two
-- inequalities by `1 - θ` and `θ`, and add. The inner-product term cancels because
-- `(1 - θ) • (x₀ - xθ) + θ • (x₁ - xθ) = 0`. Since membership in `∂_Q f(x)` already records
-- `x ∈ withTopEffectiveDomain f`, the nonemptiness hypothesis itself supplies the finiteness of
-- `f` on `Q`.
