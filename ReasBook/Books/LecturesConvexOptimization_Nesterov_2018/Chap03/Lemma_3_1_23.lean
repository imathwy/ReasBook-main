/- Lemma 3.1.23 lies in the chapter's primal-dual gap domain.

Primary domain:
- one-step primal-dual gap estimates in an ordered additive value type under primal lower bounds,
  dual upper bounds, and weak duality

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Set.Icc` / `Set.mem_Icc` in mathlib, the canonical closed-interval owner for the target bound
- `sub_nonneg` and `sub_nonpos` in mathlib, the canonical ordered-additive owners for the two
  primitive gap comparisons
- `primal_dual_decomposition_mem_Icc_and_gap_le_of_averaged_affine_lower_model` in
  `Chap03/Lemma_3_23`
- `primal_dual_decomposition_mem_Icc_and_gap_le_of_gap_le_sSup_delta` in `Chap03/Lemma_3_1_24`

Best owner abstraction:
- this theorem itself is the source-facing owner for the generic one-step decomposition interval;
  its primitive inputs are the local primal and dual comparison inequalities at the chosen pair,
  and later Chapter 3 results derive those inequalities from concrete lower-value and certificate
  constructions

Primitive data:
- the functions `f`, `φ`
- the points `xN`, `uHat`
- the comparison values `fStar`, `φStar`, `rN`
- the local comparison bounds `fStar ≤ f xN` and `φ uHat ≤ φStar`

Derived API:
- weak duality `φStar ≤ fStar`
- the residual estimate `f xN - φ uHat ≤ rN`
- any set-based or optimal-value owners used later only to derive the two local comparison bounds

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook interval estimate for the decomposition at a residual-controlled pair
- core/canonical: the order/arithmetic comparison between the decomposition and the raw
  primal-dual gap under local primal and dual comparison bounds together with weak duality
- bridge/view: the Chapter 3 certificate and affine-lower-model specializations in
  `Lemma_3_1_24` and `Lemma_3_23`

There is no stricter upstream theorem with the same generic interface. This file therefore keeps
the generic source-facing owner itself, but reduces its public inputs to the primitive local
inequalities actually used by the arithmetic instead of carrying ambient sets and global
lower/upper-bound hypotheses that direct downstream files immediately specialize back to the chosen
pair `(xN, uHat)`.

/-- Lemma 3.1.23: if `x_N` satisfies the residual estimate `(3.1.85)`, written here as
`f(x_N) - φ(\hat u_N) ≤ r_N`, then the decomposition
`(f(x_N) - f^*) + (φ^* - φ(\hat u_N))` lies between `0` and the primal-dual gap
`f(x_N) - φ(\hat u_N)`, and that gap is itself bounded above by `r_N`. -/
-- Proof sketch: the local primal and dual comparison bounds give
-- `0 ≤ f(x_N) - f^*` and `0 ≤ φ^* - φ(\hat u_N)`, so the decomposition is nonnegative. The
-- difference between the primal-dual gap and the decomposition is `f^* - φ^*`, which is
-- nonnegative by weak duality. The final upper bound is exactly the assumed residual estimate
-- `(3.1.85)`.
