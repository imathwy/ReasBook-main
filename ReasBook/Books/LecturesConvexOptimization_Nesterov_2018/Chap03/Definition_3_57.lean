Definition 3.57 lies in the chapter's Euclidean ellipsoid / cutting-plane domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `centerCutEllipsoid` in `Lemma_3_2_7`, the earlier Chapter 3 source-facing owner of the
  half-ellipsoid cut `E₊`;
- `mem_centerCutEllipsoid_iff` in `Lemma_3_2_7`, the canonical companion membership theorem;
- `affineEllipsoid` and `mem_affineEllipsoid_iff` in `Lemma_3_2_7`, the owner/view for the
  ambient ellipsoid `E(H, x̄)`;
- `Matrix.toEuclideanLin` in mathlib, the owner of the matrix action on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing/core owner: `centerCutEllipsoid`;
- bridge/view: the textbook sign-reversed inequality `0 ≤ inner ℝ g (xBar - x)`.

Primitive data:
- `H : Mat`;
- `xBar : E`;
- `g : E`.

Derived API:
- the half-ellipsoid `centerCutEllipsoid H xBar g`;
- its canonical membership theorem `mem_centerCutEllipsoid_iff`;
- the textbook reformulation below, obtained by expanding ellipsoid membership and rewriting
  `inner ℝ g (x - xBar) ≤ 0` as `0 ≤ inner ℝ g (xBar - x)`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the half-ellipsoid `E₊`;
- core/canonical: the existing chapter owner from `Lemma_3_2_7`;
- bridge/view: the expanded textbook membership formula.

This file should therefore reuse the owner directly and keep only the thin bridge needed to match
the textbook phrasing, rather than maintaining a parallel local definition `halfEllipsoid`.
