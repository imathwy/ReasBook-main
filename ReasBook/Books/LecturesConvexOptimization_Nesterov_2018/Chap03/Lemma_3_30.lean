/- Lemma 3.30 lies in the chapter's ellipsoid-method localization-containment domain.

Mandatory domain-style sampling before refinement:
- `feasibleSubsequence` and
  `feasibleSubsequence_count_eq_self_of_feasible` in `Definition_3_53`, the chapter owners for
  the source-facing feasible subsequence and counter `i(k)`;
- `localizationSets` in `Definition_3_52`, the source-facing recursive retained-region family;
- `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme.selectedLocalizationSets_subset_localizer` in `Algorithm_3_6`, the
  canonical selected-feasible containment theorem for any cutting-plane localizer;
- `EllipsoidMethod.toGeneralCuttingPlaneScheme` in `Algorithm_3_8`, the bridge from the
  ellipsoid recursion to the generic cutting-plane owner;
- `EllipsoidMethod.associatedEllipsoid` in `Algorithm_3_8`, the ellipsoid localizer supplied by
  that bridge.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the selected-feasible localization stage
  `S_(i(k)) = localizationSets Q (feasibleSubsequence Q y)`
  `(problem.oracle ∘ feasibleSubsequence Q y) (i(k))`;
- core/canonical: `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme.selectedLocalizationSets_subset_localizer`;
- bridge/view: the theorem below, which specializes that owner theorem to ellipsoids through
  `toGeneralCuttingPlaneScheme`.

Primitive data:
- the ambient convex minimization problem with separation oracle;
- the initial center and radius;
- the standard ellipsoid hypotheses `1 < n`, nonzero cut directions, initial ellipsoid cover, and
  positive definiteness of the shape matrices.

Derived API:
- the raw ellipsoid center sequence `y_k = center problem initialCenter radius k`;
- the feasible subsequence `feasibleSubsequence problem.feasibleSet y`;
- the selected feasible counter
  `i(k) = Nat.count (fun j ↦ y j ∈ problem.feasibleSet) k`;
- the associated ellipsoid sequence `E_k`;
- the ellipsoid specialization of the generic selected-stage containment theorem.

The previous version still owned this result at the ellipsoid layer. But the induction only uses
the generic cutting-plane localizer step, the oracle's infeasible-point half-space containment,
`feasibleSubsequence`, and `Nat.count`. This refinement therefore moves the actual owner theorem
to `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme` and keeps Lemma 3.30 as the ellipsoid specialization through
`toGeneralCuttingPlaneScheme`: the selected localization set `S_(i(k))` built from feasible
queried centers still lies in the raw stage-`k` ellipsoid `E_k`.

/-- Lemma 3.30: let `y_k = center problem initialCenter radius k` be the ellipsoid-method query
sequence, let `i(k) = Nat.count (fun j ↦ y j ∈ problem.feasibleSet) k` be the canonical
selected-feasible counter from Definition 3.53, and let
`X = feasibleSubsequence problem.feasibleSet y` be the corresponding feasible subsequence. Then
the selected recursive localization stage `S_(i(k))` built from the feasible queried centers and
their oracle cuts is contained in the raw stage-`k` associated ellipsoid `E_k`. -/
