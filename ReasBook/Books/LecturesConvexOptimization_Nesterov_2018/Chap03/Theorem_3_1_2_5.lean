/- Theorem 3.1.2.5 lies in the convex-composition domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- mathlib `ConvexOn`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.comp`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.subset`
- mathlib `Set.MapsTo`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: convexity of `φ ∘ ψ` on `domψ` when `φ` is convex and monotone on a convex set
  containing the range of `ψ`
- core/canonical: `ConvexOn.comp`
- bridge/view: the range-containment hypothesis `MapsTo ψ domψ I`

Primitive data:
- the domain `domψ`
- the inner map `ψ`
- the outer map `φ`
- the ambient convex set `I`
- convexity of `ψ` on `domψ`
- convexity of `φ` on `I`
- monotonicity of `φ` on `I`
- range containment `MapsTo ψ domψ I`

Derived API:
- convexity of `φ ∘ ψ` on `domψ`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the range-containment composition theorem
- core/canonical: `ConvexOn.comp`
- bridge/view: passing from the source interval hypothesis to the canonical owner-style proof
  pattern through `MapsTo ψ domψ I`

The previous revision fixed the theorem to `ℝ`, but the proof only uses the generic ordered-module
interface already present in mathlib’s convex-function owners. This file therefore keeps the
source-facing range-containment bridge theorem, while lifting it to the same ambient owner level as
`ConvexOn.comp` and `Theorem_3_1_9`. The textbook real-interval statement is recovered by
specialization.

/-- Theorem 3.1.2.5, at the generic owner level: if `ψ` is convex on `domψ`, `φ` is convex and
nondecreasing on a convex set `I` containing `ψ(domψ)`, then `φ ∘ ψ` is convex on `domψ`. The
textbook real-interval statement is the specialization `𝕜 = ℝ`, `Y = Z = ℝ`. -/
