/- Theorem 3.1.4.2 lies in the chapter's supporting-hyperplane domain.

Primary domain:
- supporting hyperplanes of closed convex sets in finite-dimensional real inner-product spaces.

Relevant sampled declarations:
- `AffineHyperplane` in `Definition_3_1_4_1`, the owner of a nonzero normal vector and an offset;
- `AffineHyperplane.IsSupporting`, the owner-level support predicate;
- `hyperplane`, the coordinate carrier used by the textbook statement;
- `IsSupportingHyperplane`, the coordinate bridge spelling of support.

Best owner abstraction:
- `AffineHyperplane`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the existence of a supporting hyperplane through a boundary point;
- core/canonical: `AffineHyperplane`, whose primitive data are a nonzero normal vector and an
  offset;
- bridge/view: `hyperplane g γ` together with `IsSupportingHyperplane Q g γ`.

Primitive data:
- the closed convex set `Q` and the boundary point `x₀`.

Derived API:
- the owner-level witness `H : AffineHyperplane E` supporting `Q` through `x₀`;
- the coordinate witness pair `(g, γ)` obtained by unpacking `H`.

The supporting object is intrinsically an `AffineHyperplane`, so this file now exposes that
owner-level theorem directly. The textbook `(g, γ)` statement is kept as a thin bridge companion,
since later files in the chapter still reuse the coordinate witness shape.
-/

/-- Theorem 3.1.4.2 on the owner surface: if `Q` is a closed convex set in a finite-dimensional
real inner-product space and `x₀` is a boundary point of `Q`, then there exists an affine
hyperplane `H` such that `x₀ ∈ H` and `H` supports `Q`. The textbook `ℝⁿ` statement is the
specialization `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose points `y_k ∉ Q` converging to `x₀`, project them to `Q`, and normalize
-- the displacement vectors `y_k - π_Q(y_k)` to unit normals `g_k`. The projection inequality
-- gives supporting affine hyperplanes `H_k`; compactness of the unit sphere and convergence of
-- the projections yield a limit hyperplane `H` supporting `Q` and passing through `x₀`.
