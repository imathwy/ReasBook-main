variable {ι : Type u} {X : Type v}

/- Theorem 3.1.2.4 is a recall-only `Set.univ` specialization in the chapter's closed-convex
pointwise-supremum domain.

Relevant sampled declarations in this domain:
- `pointwiseSupremumOn` in `Theorem_3_1_8`, the source-facing owner for subset-indexed pointwise
  suprema of `WithTop ℝ`-valued families;
- `pointwiseSupremumOnEffectiveDomain` in `Theorem_3_1_8`, the canonical effective-domain bridge
  for that owner;
- `ClosedConvexOn` in `Definition_3_1_1_5`, the chapter owner predicate for closed convexity on a
  feasible set;
- `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup` in `Theorem_3_1_8`, the owner theorem for closed-convex
  stability under subset-indexed pointwise suprema.

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical owner: `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup` on
  `pointwiseSupremumOn Δ φ`;
- bridge/view: the `Δ = Set.univ` specialization used in this numbered textbook item.

Primitive data:
- none in this file; the pointwise-supremum owner and its effective-domain bridge already live
  upstream.

Derived API:
- this recall-only `Set.univ` specialization.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Theorem 3.1.2.4 as the all-indices specialization of the pointwise-supremum
  closed-convexity theorem;
- core/canonical: `pointwiseSupremumOn`, `pointwiseSupremumOnEffectiveDomain`, and
  `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`;
- bridge/view: the passage from an arbitrary subset `Δ` to `Set.univ`.

The previous file introduced a second theorem name `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_iSup` for this
specialization. The owner theorem already exists upstream on the correct abstraction layer, so this
file is now recall-only and keeps no parallel local theorem copy.
