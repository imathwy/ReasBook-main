namespace SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem

/- Definition 4.3.1 lies in the unconstrained second-order minimization domain on complete real
inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.unconstrained` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the Chapter 1
  owner for whole-space minimization problems;
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian`, written on theorem surfaces as `f ∈ C22[L3]`, in
  `Definition_4_2_7`, the Chapter 4 owner for globally Lipschitz Hessian data;
* `argmin[Q]` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the canonical
  minimizer-set owner for a feasible set;
* `IsMinOn` in mathlib, the canonical minimizer predicate on a set.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the textbook description of a whole-space problem with Lipschitz Hessian and an
  attained minimum;
* core/canonical: `problem.feasibleSet = Set.univ ∧ ∃ L3 : NNReal, problem.objective ∈ C22[L3]`
  together with `(argmin[problem.feasibleSet] problem).Nonempty`;
* bridge/view: the specialization to `unconstrained f` and the explicit `IsMinOn` reformulations
  below.

Primitive data:
* the constrained problem `problem`;
* the ambient objective `f` when specializing to the whole-space owner `unconstrained f`.

Derived API:
* the Chapter 1 owner `unconstrained f`;
* the Chapter 4 regularity owner surface `problem.objective ∈ C22[L3]`;
* solvability as nonemptiness of the canonical minimizer set.
* the source-style positive-witness reformulation, derived by enlarging any `C22[L3]` witness.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Definition 4.3.1's whole-space Hessian-Lipschitz condition and solvability
  language;
* core/canonical: the conjunction above and `(argmin[problem.feasibleSet] problem).Nonempty`;
* bridge/view: `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` and the `unconstrained` specialization.

Definition 4.3.1 adds no new owner beyond the Chapter 1 whole-space problem owner, the Chapter 4
`C22[L3]` owner, and the canonical minimizer-set owner. The earlier local class
`IsSecondOrderUnconstrainedWithLipschitzHessian` and alias `IsSolvable` only repackaged those
owners, so this file stays at direct recall/check surface. -/

/- Definition 4.3.1: a second-order unconstrained minimization problem with Lipschitz Hessian is
exactly a constrained problem whose feasible set is all of `E` and whose objective belongs to
`C22[L3]` for some witness `L3`. The source's strict positivity requirement is the companion
reformulation `problem.exists_pos_mem_C22_iff`, not the main recall surface. -/
