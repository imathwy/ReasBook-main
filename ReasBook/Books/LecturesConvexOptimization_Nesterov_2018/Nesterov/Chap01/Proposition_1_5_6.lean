noncomputable section

/- Proposition 1.5.6 is `source-facing` in first-order smooth optimization.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook affine objective `x ↦ α + ⟪a, x⟫` belongs to `C^{1,1}_0`
* core/canonical: the primitive affine owner `E →ᴬ[ℝ] ℝ` together with the Chapter 1 target
  predicate `ContDiff ℝ 1 f ∧ LipschitzWith 0 (∇ f)` from Definition 1.5.2
* bridge/view: coercion from `ContinuousAffineMap` to functions, and the owner-side gradient
  formula below

Primary domain:
* affine real-valued objectives on real Hilbert spaces

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `ContinuousAffineMap.contDiff`
* `ContinuousAffineMap.hasFDerivAt`
* `ContDiff ℝ 1 f`
* `LipschitzWith L (∇ f)`
* `LipschitzWith.const`

Best owner abstraction:
* `ContinuousAffineMap ℝ E ℝ` for the affine objective itself

Primitive data:
* a continuous affine functional `f : E →ᴬ[ℝ] ℝ`

Derived API:
* its `C¹` regularity
* the constant-gradient formula
* the global `0`-Lipschitz bound on the gradient

The proposition stays source-facing, but its proof now factors through the canonical affine owner
instead of rebuilding the affine calculus directly on the raw lambda term.

The textbook statement is about `ℝⁿ`, but the proof only uses the real Hilbert-space gradient API,
so the canonical owner theorem lives at that intrinsic level.

/-- Proposition 1.5.6: the affine function `x ↦ α + ⟪a, x⟫` is `C¹` and its gradient is globally
`0`-Lipschitz, equivalently it belongs to the class `C^{1,1}_0`. This is the intrinsic
Hilbert-space form of the textbook `ℝⁿ` statement. -/
-- Proof sketch: package `x ↦ α + ⟪a, x⟫` as the continuous affine functional
-- `(innerSL ℝ a).toContinuousAffineMap +ᵥ ContinuousAffineMap.const ℝ E α`, apply the owner-level
-- `ContinuousAffineMap.contDiff_one_and_gradient_lipschitz_zero`, and then evaluate the coercion.
