/- Definition 1.2.9 lies in the black-box optimization-oracle / differential-answer-map domain.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook zero-, first-, and second-order oracle replies attached to an
  objective function;
* core/canonical: the Chapter 1 owner abstraction `Query → Answer` from Definition 1.2.2, with
  first- and second-order replies constrained by the pointwise owners `HasGradientAt` and
  `HasFDerivAt (∇ f)`;
* bridge/view: the Hessian matrix view from `Definition_1_4_16.lean`, which presents the owner
  Hessian operator `hessian f x` in coordinates.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `#check (Query → Answer)` in `Definition_1_2_2.lean`;
* `HasGradientAt` in `Definition_1_4_6.lean`, the pointwise owner for genuine first-order data;
* `SatisfiesExactLineSearch` in `Definition_1_6_3.lean`, which keeps `HasGradientAt` explicit
  rather than trusting the totalized gradient alone;
* `HasWeightedGradientSecondOrderExpansionAt` in `Definition_1_8_4.lean`, whose canonical bridge
  target is `HasGradientAt f g x ∧ HasFDerivAt (∇ f) H x`.

Owner abstraction:
* the oracle answer-map type `Query → Answer`

Primitive data:
* the objective function itself

Derived API:
* the zero-order value map `f`
* the first-order value-gradient map `x ↦ (f x, ∇ f x)` under the genuine-gradient owner
  `∀ x, HasGradientAt f (∇ f x) x`
* the second-order value-gradient-Hessian map `x ↦ (f x, ∇ f x, hessian f x)` under the genuine
  first- and second-order owners `HasGradientAt` and `HasFDerivAt (∇ f)`

Accordingly, this file recalls the canonical answer maps directly and introduces no parallel
public wrapper names for them. The zero-order clause stays at the bare function level, while the
first- and second-order clauses make the needed regularity assumptions explicit so that the
displayed answers are genuine differential data rather than totalized placeholders. -/
