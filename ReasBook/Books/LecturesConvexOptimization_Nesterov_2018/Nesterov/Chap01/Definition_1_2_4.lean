/- Definition 1.2.4 lies in the Chapter 1 black-box optimization problem-class domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `#check (Type u)` in `Definition_1_2_1.lean` for the model `Σ`;
* `#check (Query → Answer)` in `Definition_1_2_2.lean` for each fixed-problem oracle;
* `#check (Set State)` in `Definition_1_2_3.lean` for the stopping criterion `𝒯_ε`;
* `GeneralIterativeScheme.shouldStop` in `Algorithm_1_2_10.lean` for a downstream consumer of the
  same stopping-criterion owner.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook triple `𝒫 ≡ (Σ, 𝒪, 𝒯_ε)`;
* core/canonical: the owner expressions `Type`, `Query → Answer`, and `Set State`;
* bridge/view: for fixed `σ : 𝒫.model`, the evaluation `𝒫.oracle σ : Query → Answer`.

The owner abstraction stays source-facing: the primitive data are exactly the model, class oracle,
and stopping criterion, each stored in its canonical owner type. -/

/-- Definition 1.2.4: a black-box optimization problem class is the triple
`𝒫 ≡ (Σ, 𝒪, 𝒯_ε)`, where `Σ` is a model of problems, `𝒪` is the class oracle, and `𝒯_ε` is the
chosen stopping criterion. The accuracy threshold is already part of the source-facing stopping
criterion `𝒯_ε`, so it is not stored as separate primitive data in the owner. -/
