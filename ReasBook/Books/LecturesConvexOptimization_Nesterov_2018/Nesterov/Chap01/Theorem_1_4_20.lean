/- Theorem 1.4.20 is a source-facing item in second-order smooth optimization.

Relevant owner declarations sampled before refinement:
* `hessian` from `Definition_1_4_16`
* `isLocalMin_hasGradientAt_zero_of_differentiableAt` from `Theorem_1_4_13`
* `gradient_eq_zero_of_not_differentiableAt`
* `fderiv_gradient_isSymmetric_of_contDiffAt` from `Theorem_1_4_19`
* `ContinuousLinearMap.isPositive_iff`

Best owner abstractions:
* source-facing: the Hessian quadratic-form condition
  `∀ s, 0 ≤ inner ℝ (hessian f xStar s) s`
* bridge/view: the positive-operator conclusion
  `ContinuousLinearMap.IsPositive (hessian f xStar)` under `ContDiffAt ℝ 2 f xStar`

Primitive data:
* `f`
* `xStar`
* local minimality of `f` at `xStar`
* differentiability of `f` at `xStar`
* differentiability of `∇ f` at `xStar`

Derived API:
* vanishing gradient at `xStar`
* nonnegativity of the Hessian quadratic form at `xStar`
* positivity of the Hessian operator at `xStar` once Hessian symmetry is supplied canonically by
  `ContDiffAt.isSymmSndFDerivAt`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the combined first- and second-order necessary conditions
* core/canonical: `∇ f xStar = 0` together with the directional inequality
  `∀ s, 0 ≤ inner ℝ (hessian f xStar s) s`
* bridge/view: the `C²` upgrade to `ContinuousLinearMap.IsPositive`; Euclidean matrix
  restatements belong in separate Hessian-matrix view files

The public API therefore keeps the source-facing quadratic-form theorem as the main entry. The
positive-operator statement is retained only as the thin `C²` bridge that reuses the canonical
second-derivative symmetry owner instead of routing through a separate Euclidean coordinate view. -/
