/- Primary domain: twice continuously differentiable smooth convex analysis on finite-dimensional
real inner-product spaces with seminorm-controlled gradient smoothness.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining this file:
* `ConvexC1On` in `Definition_2_4`
* `𝓕[L, p]¹¹` in `Theorem_2_5`
* `convexOn_iff_hessian_quadratic_form_nonneg` in `Theorem_2_4`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]¹¹`
* core/canonical: `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ f` together with the upper Hessian quadratic-form bound
* bridge/view: the owner theorem
  `ConvexC1SeminormSmooth.hessian_quadratic_form_upper_bound` and the explicit lower-and-upper
  Hessian quadratic-form inequalities in
  `convexC1SeminormSmooth_iff_hessian_quadratic_form_bounded`

The owner abstraction here is `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]¹¹`.
Primitive data: the whole-space `C¹` convexity owner `ConvexC1On Set.univ f` and the defining
dual-norm Lipschitz bound for `∇ f`.
Derived API: `hf.contDiff`, `hf.convexOn`, `hf.dualNorm_gradient_sub_le`, and via Theorem 2.4 the
nonnegativity of the Hessian quadratic form. The only genuinely new second-order ingredient here
is the upper bound `inner ℝ (hessian f x h) h ≤ (L : ℝ) * (p h) ^ 2`. This matches the textbook
`ℝⁿ` setting through the chapter owner `𝓕[L, p]¹¹`, rather than over-generalizing beyond the
available first-order owner layer. -/
