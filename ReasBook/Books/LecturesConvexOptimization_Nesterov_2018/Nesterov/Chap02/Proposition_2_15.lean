Primary domain: convex-geometric subsets of `ℝ²` expressed as owner sets in `Set (ℝ × ℝ)`,
with Proposition 2.15 stated directly as pointwise set identities.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining this file:
* `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`, the imported chapter owner set `Q`
* `nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay`, the imported chapter owner set `ℝ_+^{1,2}`
* `Set.mem_add`, the canonical bridge for pointwise Minkowski addition of sets
* `Set.mem_sub`, the canonical bridge for pointwise set subtraction

Owner abstraction:
* the owner sets already live in `ReciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay.lean`, so this file now keeps
  only the source-facing set identities at the same `Set (ℝ × ℝ)` level.

Primitive data:
* none locally; both owner sets are imported

Derived API:
* the two source-facing set equalities of Proposition 2.15

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the two set identities asserted in Proposition 2.15
* core/canonical: the imported owner sets as subsets of `ℝ × ℝ`, together with pointwise `Set`
  addition and subtraction
* bridge/view: the imported membership theorems

/-- Proposition 2.15 (1): subtracting the nonnegative first-coordinate ray from `Q` gives exactly
the open upper half-plane `{x ∈ ℝ² | x₂ > 0}`. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `y = x - r` with `x ∈ Q` and `r` on the horizontal ray, then the second
-- coordinate is unchanged and remains positive because `x.1 > 0` and `x.2 ≥ 1 / x.1`. For the
-- reverse inclusion, given `y.2 > 0`, choose `x.1` large enough so that `1 / x.1 ≤ y.2` and
-- `y.1 ≤ x.1`, then set `x := (x.1, y.2)` and `r := x - y`.

/-- Proposition 2.15 (2): adding the nonnegative first-coordinate ray to `Q` leaves `Q`
unchanged. -/
-- Proof sketch: adding `(r, 0)` only increases the first coordinate, so the reciprocal bound
-- `1 / x₁` decreases while the second coordinate stays fixed; the opposite inclusion follows from
-- the zero vector lying on the ray.
