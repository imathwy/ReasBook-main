Theorem 2.28 lies in the convex-geometry and topological-closure domain for subsets of
finite-dimensional real normed spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `PointedCone.hull` together with `PointedCone.convex`
* `IsClosed.add_left_of_isCompact` and `IsClosed.add_right_of_isCompact`
* `Convex.convexJoin`, `segment_eq_image_lineMap`, and
  `AffineMap.lineMap_continuous_uncurry`
* `Convex.affine_image`, `Convex.affine_preimage`, `IsClosed.preimage`,
  `Metric.isCompact_iff_isClosed_bounded`, and `IsCompact.image`

Best owner abstractions:
* `PointedCone ℝ E` for conic hulls
* `IsCompact Q` for the compact-source bridge items
* `Convex ℝ s` for convexity-preservation items
* `IsClosed s` and `IsCompact s` for the finite-dimensional closedness bridges
* affine maps `E₁ →ᵃ[ℝ] E₂` for the image/preimage items, with compactness supplying the
  closed-image bridge

Primitive data:
* finite-dimensional real normed spaces `E`, `E₁`
* real normed codomains `E₂`
* sets `Q₁`, `Q₂`
* an affine map `f`

Derived API:
* direct owner recalls for the intersection, product, convex-join, and affine image/preimage
  closure rules
* the compact-source bridge theorem for item (8)
* the source-facing finite-dimensional bridge statements in items (4), (8), (10), and (12)

Source/core/bridge triage:
* direct owner recall/use: items (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (9), (11), (13), and (14)
* source-facing bridge items: (4), (10), and (12)
* bridge/view compact-source core: item (8) as `isClosed_hull_of_isCompact_of_zero_not_mem`
* derived source-facing corollary: the Euclidean-style closed-and-bounded form of item (8)

This file therefore reuses direct owner recalls wherever the exact API already exists, keeps the
compact-source core visible where compactness is the real primitive input, and derives the
textbook closed-and-bounded corollaries from that core.
