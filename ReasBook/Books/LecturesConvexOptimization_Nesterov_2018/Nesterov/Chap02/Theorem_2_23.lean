/- Primary domain: one-dimensional quadratic counterexamples for the weighted sampled point built
from an actual optimal-method trajectory.

Sampled owner declarations before refining this file:
* `GeneralOptimalMethodScheme` in `Algorithm_2_2`, the chapter's owner for genuine Algorithm 2.2
  trajectories, including the step-`(c)` descent axiom;
* `OptimalMethodRecurrence.weightedAverage` in `Algorithm_2_2`, the canonical owner of the
  weighted sampled point attached to the underlying recurrence data;
* `constantStepSchemeIToGeneralOptimalMethodScheme` in `Algorithm_2_3`, the canonical bridge from
  the recursive exact-step trajectory to an actual optimal-method scheme;
* `quadraticObjective` and `quadraticObjective_gradient_eq` in Chapter 1, the canonical Euclidean
  quadratic owner and its gradient formula.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the counterexample theorem for the weighted sampled point at stage `k`;
* core/canonical: an actual `GeneralOptimalMethodScheme` witness together with the owner weighted
  sampled point inherited from its underlying recurrence;
* bridge/view: `constantStepSchemeIToGeneralOptimalMethodScheme`, used only to realize a genuine
  Algorithm 2.2 trajectory from the recursive exact-step construction.

Primitive data:
* the linear coefficient `linearCoeff` of the degenerate quadratic objective
  `quadraticObjective 0 linearCoeff 0`;
* the actual scheme witness `method`.

Derived API:
* the weighted sampled point
  `\hat y_k = (λ_k / (1 - λ_k)) ∑_{i < k} (α_i / λ_{i+1}) y_i`,
  owned by `OptimalMethodRecurrence.weightedAverage`;
* the constant-gradient evaluation
  `∇ (quadraticObjective 0 linearCoeff 0) x = linearCoeff`.

/-- Theorem 2.23: for every stage `k` and threshold `M`, there is a one-dimensional quadratic
objective together with an actual optimal-method scheme whose weighted sampled point
`\hat y_k = (λ_k / (1 - λ_k)) ∑_{i < k} (α_i / λ_{i+1}) y_i`,
formed from the owner data `λ_k = method.weight k`, `α_i = method.alpha i`, and `y_i = method.y i`,
has gradient norm at least `M`. -/
-- Proof sketch: fix `k` and `M`. Use the degenerate quadratic owner
-- `quadraticObjective 0 linearCoeff 0` with `linearCoeff = M e₀`. Its gradient is constant,
-- `∇ f x = linearCoeff` for every `x`. Realize an actual Algorithm 2.2 trajectory for this
-- objective by the canonical bridge
-- `constantStepSchemeIToGeneralOptimalMethodScheme`. Since the gradient is constant, the weighted
-- sampled point `\hat y_k` can be arbitrary and still satisfies
-- `‖∇ f \hat y_k‖ = ‖linearCoeff‖ = |M| ≥ M`.
