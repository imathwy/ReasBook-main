/- Theorem 2.3 lies in Euclidean first-order convex analysis on convex sets.

Sampled owner-style declarations before refining this file:
* mathlib `ConvexOn`
* mathlib `gradientWithin` / `HasGradientWithinAt`
* `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane` in `Definition_2_2`, the chapter owner theorem for the
  source-facing first-order inequality
* `ConvexC1On` in `Definition_2_4`, the chapter owner packaging of the textbook `C¹` hypothesis

Best owner abstraction:
* `ConvexOn ℝ Q f`, with `gradientWithin f Q` as the canonical first-order object derived from the
  within-set differentiability owner predicate `DifferentiableOn ℝ f Q`

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `Q`
* the objective `f`
* the convexity owner predicate `ConvexOn ℝ Q f`
* the within-set differentiability owner predicate `DifferentiableOn ℝ f Q`

Derived API:
* `GradientMonotoneOn Q f`, the bridge property recording monotonicity of `gradientWithin f Q`
* `convexOn_iff_gradient_monotone`, the source-facing equivalence between convexity and gradient
  monotonicity
* `ConvexOn.gradient_monotone` and `ConvexOn.of_gradient_monotone`, the owner forward and reverse
  implications
* `convexC1On_iff_gradient_monotone`, the textbook `C¹` bridge through the chapter owner
  `ConvexC1On`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Theorem 2.3 as the equivalence between convexity and monotonicity of the
  within-set gradient; the textbook `C¹` hypothesis is routed through `ConvexC1On`
* core/canonical: `ConvexOn ℝ Q f`
* bridge/view: passage through the lower-tangent-plane owner API from `Definition_2_2` and the
  chapter owner `ConvexC1On`

/-- Theorem 2.3, stated on the canonical real Hilbert-space owner layer: for a convex set `Q` and
a function `f : E → ℝ` that is differentiable on `Q`, convexity of `f` on `Q` is equivalent to
monotonicity of its within-set gradient on `Q`; the main theorem is stated with the owner
hypothesis `DifferentiableOn ℝ f Q`, and the textbook `C¹` version appears below as a companion
bridge through `ConvexC1On`. The textbook Euclidean theorem is the finite-dimensional
specialization. -/
-- Proof sketch: combine the internal forward and reverse implications between convexity and the
-- monotonicity inequality for `gradientWithin f Q`.
