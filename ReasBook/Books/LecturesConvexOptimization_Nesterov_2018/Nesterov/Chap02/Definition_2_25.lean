Definition 2.25 is a source-facing recall in the Euclidean set-constrained minimization domain.

Primary domain:
* constrained minimization on `ℝⁿ`

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the Chapter 1 owner object
  for a feasible set together with an ambient real-valued objective;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.coe_apply`, the coercion view of a problem as its objective
  function;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.toGeneralMinimizationProblem`, the canonical bridge to the
  older zero-constraint owner;
* `IsMinOn`, the canonical minimizer predicate on a set.

Best owner abstraction:
* `problem : SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E`

Primitive data:
* `feasibleSet : Set E`
* `objective : E → ℝ`

Derived API:
* the coercion `problem : E → ℝ`
* the minimizer predicate `IsMinOn problem problem.feasibleSet x`
* the bridge `problem.toGeneralMinimizationProblem`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the constrained problem `min_{x ∈ Q} f(x)` on `ℝⁿ`
* core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E` together with
  `IsMinOn problem problem.feasibleSet x`
* bridge/view: `problem.toGeneralMinimizationProblem`

The textbook presentation with an objective written only on `Q` is represented in the project by
an ambient objective together with the feasible set `Q`; only the restriction of that ambient
objective to `Q` affects the minimization semantics. This file therefore recalls the owner
abstraction directly and keeps no parallel public wrapper such as
`ConstrainedMinimizationProblem` or `GlobalConstrainedMinimizer`.
