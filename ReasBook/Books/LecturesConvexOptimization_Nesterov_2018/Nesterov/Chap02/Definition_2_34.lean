/- Definition 2.34 lies in the distance-to-set / projection domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `Metric.infDist`, the canonical distance-to-set owner;
* `Metric.lipschitz_infDist_pt`, showing that pointwise distance-to-set constructions are owned by
  `Metric.infDist`;
* `Metric.continuous_infDist_pt`, the intrinsic continuity bridge attached to the same owner;
* `IsProjectionPointOn Q x p` in `Chap07/Definition_7_3`, the project owner predicate for nearest
  points, used only in the normed bridge below.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the half squared distance to a set;
* core/canonical: `Metric.infDist`;
* bridge/view: the projection-point evaluation formula below.

Primitive data:
* the set `Q` and the ambient point `x`.

Derived API:
* continuity/Lipschitz consequences inherited from `Metric.infDist`;
* the projection-point evaluation formula.

Accordingly, this file exposes the source-facing owner directly as a set-based function derived
from `Metric.infDist`, without hard-coding convexity or the Euclidean `ℝⁿ` display model into the
public owner. -/

/-- Definition 2.34: the half squared distance to a set sends `x` to one half of the square of
its minimal distance to `Q`. The textbook Euclidean statement is the specialization to `ℝⁿ`. -/
def Set.halfSquaredDistance (Q : Set E) : E → ℝ :=

variable {E : Type u} [SeminormedAddCommGroup E]

/-- For any projection point `p` of `x` onto `Q`, the half squared distance equals one half of
the squared norm of the displacement `x - p`. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `p` is a projection point of `x` onto `Q`, then by definition
-- `‖x - p‖ = infDist x Q`. Substitute this equality into the definition based on `Metric.infDist`.
