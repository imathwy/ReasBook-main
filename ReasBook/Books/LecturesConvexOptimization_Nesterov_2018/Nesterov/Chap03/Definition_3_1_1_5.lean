/- Definition 3.1.1.5 lives in the chapter's `WithTop`-valued convex-analysis API.

Primary domain:
- closed convex extended-real-valued functions on real topological modules, specializing to the
  textbook `ℝⁿ` setting.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- `withTopEffectiveDomain`, `withTopRealPart`, `constrainedEpigraph` from `Definition_3_3`
- mathlib `ConvexOn`
- mathlib `convexOn_iff_convex_epigraph`

Owner abstraction:
- source-facing owner: `ClosedConvexOn Q f`
- core/canonical convexity view: `ConvexOn ℝ Q (withTopRealPart f)`
- primitive bridge data: `dom f` and `constrainedEpigraph Q f`

Primitive data:
- the domain inclusion `Q ⊆ dom f`
- the closedness of `constrainedEpigraph Q f`
- the convexity of `constrainedEpigraph Q f`

Derived API:
- `constrainedEpigraph_eq_epigraph_withTopRealPart`
- the projection lemmas out of `ClosedConvexOn`
- `ClosedConvexOn.convexOn_withTopRealPart`
- `ClosedConvexOn.convex`
- `ClosedConvexFunction f` as the special case `Q = dom f`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `ClosedConvexOn`, `ClosedConvexFunction`
- core/canonical: `withTopEffectiveDomain`, `constrainedEpigraph`, `ConvexOn`
- bridge/view: `constrainedEpigraph_eq_epigraph_withTopRealPart`, the projection lemmas, and the
  `ConvexOn` consequences on `dom f`

This file therefore reuses the owner effective-domain abstraction directly instead of keeping a
parallel set-level presentation, while exposing the canonical `ConvexOn` owner view as derived
API rather than storing it as parallel primitive data. -/
