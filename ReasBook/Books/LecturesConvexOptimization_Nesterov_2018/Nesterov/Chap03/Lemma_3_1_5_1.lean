Lemma 3.1.5.1 lies in the chapter's extended-valued constrained-subdifferential / closed-convex
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `∂[Q] f(x)` / `constrainedSubdifferential` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the owner local subgradient
  object;
- `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the atomic membership expansion for
  that owner;
- `convexOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty` in `Lemma_3_6`, the canonical convexity
  consequence of pointwise constrained-subdifferential nonemptiness;
- `lowerSemicontinuousOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty` in `Lemma_3_6`, the companion
  lower-semicontinuity consequence.

Best owner abstraction:
- the constrained-subdifferential owner `∂[Q] f(x)` together with its atomic membership lemma;
- the two exact owner consequences already proved in `Lemma_3_6`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q`;
- the `WithTop ℝ`-valued objective `f`;
- pointwise nonemptiness of `∂[Q] f(x)` on `Q`.

Derived API in this file:
- the atomic finiteness consequence `Q ⊆ dom f`;
- the exact owner recalls for convexity and lower semicontinuity on `Q`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook pointwise-subgradient hypothesis and its atomic finiteness
  consequence `Q ⊆ dom f`;
- core/canonical: `dom f`, `∂[Q] f(x)`, `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`, and the two owner
  consequence theorems from `Lemma_3_6`;
- bridge/view: none in this file.

This file therefore keeps only the genuinely new atomic finiteness theorem at the weakest ambient
subgradient layer, and reuses the exact convexity and lower-semicontinuity owner theorems by
direct recall instead of exporting a stronger repackaging layer.

/-- Lemma 3.1.5.1: if every point of `Q` has a nonempty constrained subdifferential, then `f` is
finite on `Q`. The convexity conclusion, which does require convexity of `Q`, and the companion
lower-semicontinuity conclusion are already the exact owner theorems recalled just below. -/
-- Proof sketch: membership in `∂[Q] f(x)` already contains the primitive
-- domain fact `x ∈ dom f`, so pointwise nonemptiness on `Q` immediately yields `Q ⊆ dom f`.
