/- Definition 3.1.6 is a recall-only item in the chapter's common-subdifferential domain.

Primary domain:
- convex analysis of extended-real-valued functions on real inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `subdifferential`, the pointwise owner for subgradients
- `commonRegularSubdifferential`, the canonical owner for the intersection of pointwise
  subdifferentials over a set
- `mem_commonRegularSubdifferential_iff`, the membership bridge for that owner

Best owner abstraction:
- `commonRegularSubdifferential`

Primitive data inside the owner abstraction:
- an extended-real-valued function `f`
- a set `X`

Derived API:
- the textbook notation `∂̂ f(X)`
- the membership expansion `g ∈ ∂̂ f(X) ↔ ∀ x ∈ X, g ∈ ∂ f(x)`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the epigraph facet of `X` with respect to `f`
- core/canonical: `commonRegularSubdifferential f X`
- bridge/view: `mem_commonRegularSubdifferential_iff`

The textbook defines the epigraph facet for a closed convex set `X ⊆ dom f`, but those extra
hypotheses are not primitive data for the underlying owner. This file therefore reuses the
existing common-subdifferential owner directly rather than introducing a new synonym or keeping a
Euclidean-coordinate wrapper. -/

/- Definition 3.1.6: for a closed convex set `X ⊆ dom f`, the epigraph facet of `X` with respect
to `f` is the common regular subdifferential `∂̂ f(X) = ⋂ x ∈ X, ∂ f(x)`. -/
