/- Proposition 3.1.2.1 lies in the chapter's closed-convex weighted pointwise-supremum domain.

Primary domain:
- weighted pointwise suprema of `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions on a real topological module.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `pointwiseSupremumOn` and `pointwiseSupremumOn_apply`
- `pointwiseSupremumOnEffectiveDomain`
- `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`
- `ClosedConvexOn.nonneg_smul` and `ClosedConvexOn.add_inter`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: this proposition, which bridges componentwise closed-convexity and nonnegative
  weights to the chapter owner theorem for pointwise suprema
- core/canonical: `pointwiseSupremumOn`, `pointwiseSupremumOnEffectiveDomain`, and
  `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`
- bridge/view: the weighted slice family
  `fun x weights ↦ ∑ i, (weights i : WithTop ℝ) * f i x`

Primitive data:
- a weight set `Δ : Set (ι → ℝ)`
- a family `f : ι → X → WithTop ℝ`
- nonemptiness of `Δ`
- coordinatewise nonnegativity of the weights in `Δ`
- closed-convexity of each component `f i`

Derived API:
- the weighted-slice pointwise-supremum owner
  `pointwiseSupremumOn Δ (fun x weights ↦ ∑ i, (weights i : WithTop ℝ) * f i x)`
- the closed-convexity theorem below for that owner

This proposition is not recall-only: its mathematical content is the bridge from the componentwise
assumptions on the family `f i` and the coordinatewise nonnegative weight functions in `Δ` to
the slicewise hypothesis required by `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`. The later file
`Proposition_3_9` therefore
reuses this theorem directly instead of keeping a second public copy of the same bridge. -/

-- Proof sketch: first prove each weighted slice is a closed convex function by finite induction on
-- the sum, using the nonnegative weighted-add rule at each step. Then identify the effective
-- epigraph of the pointwise supremum with the intersection of the slice effective epigraphs. The
-- closedness and convexity fields of `ClosedConvexFunction` then follow from intersection
-- stability.
