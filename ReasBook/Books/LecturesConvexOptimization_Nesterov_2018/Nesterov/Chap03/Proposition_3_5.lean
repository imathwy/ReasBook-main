/- Proposition 3.5 lives in the chapter's one-dimensional `WithTop`-valued convex-analysis
domain.

Primary domain:
- the reciprocal function on `(0, ∞)`, its `⊤`-extension to `ℝ`, its epigraph, and its effective
  domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- chapter `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay` from `Chap02/ReciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`;
- chapter `dom f` and `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph f` from `Definition_3_3`;
- mathlib `ConvexOn`;
- mathlib `strictConvexOn_zpow`;
- mathlib `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_epigraph`.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing owner: `positiveReciprocalExtension`;
- core/canonical derived owners: `dom positiveReciprocalExtension`,
  `effectiveEpigraph positiveReciprocalExtension`, and the already established Chapter 2 set owner
  `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`.

Primitive data:
- the extended reciprocal function `positiveReciprocalExtension`.

Derived API:
- the identification of the canonical effective epigraph with the Chapter 2 owner set
  `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`;
- convexity on `Set.Ioi 0`;
- lower semicontinuity;
- closedness of `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`;
- identification and openness of the canonical effective domain.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `positiveReciprocalExtension`;
- core/canonical: `dom`, `effectiveEpigraph`, `ConvexOn`, `LowerSemicontinuous`;
- bridge/view: the epigraph-identification theorem relating the Chapter 3 extension to the
  Chapter 2 owner set, and the source-facing named consequences about this function.

This file therefore keeps the reciprocal extension itself as the owner declaration, but reuses the
chapter owners `dom` and `effectiveEpigraph` together with the existing Chapter 2 owner
`reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay` for the effective-domain and epigraph surfaces instead of
introducing parallel local set definitions or keeping closedness only on a longer bridge/view
expression. -/
