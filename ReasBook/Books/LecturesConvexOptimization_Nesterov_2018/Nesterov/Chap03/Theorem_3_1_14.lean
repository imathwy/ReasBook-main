/- Theorem 3.1.14 is a recall-only file in the chapter's affine-hyperplane support domain.

Relevant sampled declarations:
- `AffineHyperplane`
- `AffineHyperplane.IsSupporting`
- `IsSupportingHyperplane`
- `exists_supporting_hyperplane_at_boundary_point_of_closed_convex`

Best owner abstraction:
- the earlier source-facing theorem
  `exists_supporting_hyperplane_at_boundary_point_of_closed_convex`, built on the chapter's
  `AffineHyperplane` owner API.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: this numbered theorem item;
- core/canonical: the earlier chapter theorem with the same mathematical content;
- bridge/view: this later theorem name, which is only a textual restatement of the same result.

Primitive data:
- the closed convex set `Q` and the boundary point `x₀`.

Derived API:
- the coordinate witness `(g, γ)` together with membership in `hyperplane g γ` and the predicate
  `IsSupportingHyperplane Q g γ`.

This file previously duplicated the exact theorem surface already provided by
`Theorem_3_1_4_2.lean`. It now reuses that earlier declaration directly instead of keeping a
second parallel theorem with the same statement under a different name.
