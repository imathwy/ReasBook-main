-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

open scoped WithTopConvexAnalysis

/- Proposition 3.12 lies in the chapter's one-dimensional positive-part / subdifferential domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `posPart`
- `posPart_def`
- `subdifferential`
- `mem_subdifferential_iff`

Best owner abstraction:
- the chapter owner `subdifferential`, specialized to the lifted positive-part map
  `fun x : ℝ ↦ ((x⁺ : ℝ) : WithTop ℝ)`

Primitive data:
- the canonical positive-part owner `x ↦ x⁺`
- the owner-level subgradient predicate from `mem_subdifferential_iff`

Derived API:
- the interval description of the source-facing subdifferential at `0`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the subdifferential of `x ↦ (x)_+` at `0`
- core/canonical: `subdifferential`
- bridge/view: `mem_subdifferential_iff`, `posPart_def`

This file therefore removes the duplicate raw set-builder formulation and states the textbook claim
directly on the chapter owner `∂ f(x)`, while keeping the same mathematical meaning. -/

/-- Proposition 3.12: for `f(x) = (x)_+`, the subdifferential at `0` is exactly the interval
`[0, 1]`. -/
-- Proof sketch: rewrite membership in the owner subdifferential `∂ f(0)` via
-- `mem_subdifferential_coe_real_iff`, which produces the textbook support inequality
-- `x⁺ ≥ g * x`. Testing at `x = -1` and `x = 1` gives `0 ≤ g ≤ 1`. Conversely, if
-- `g ∈ [0, 1]`, then `g * x ≤ x⁺` follows from the cases `x ≥ 0` and `x ≤ 0`.
