/- This item is a source-facing recall in the chapter's extended-valued constrained
subdifferential domain.

Primary domain:
- convex analysis of extended-real-valued functions on real inner-product spaces.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `IsSubgradientAt`, the upstream source-facing owner for affine lower-support inequalities on the
  effective domain;
- `subdifferential`, the unconstrained set-valued owner derived from `IsSubgradientAt`;
- `constrainedSubdifferential`, the canonical owner for the textbook constrained subdifferential;
- `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`, the defining membership expansion for that owner.

Best owner abstraction:
- `constrainedSubdifferential`

Primitive data:
- a feasible set `Q`
- an extended-real-valued function `f`
- a base point `x0`

Derived API:
- the source-facing notation `∂[Q] f(x0)`
- `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook constrained subdifferential `∂_Q f(x₀)`
- core/canonical: `constrainedSubdifferential`
- bridge/view: `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`

This file therefore reuses the existing chapter owner directly instead of introducing a Euclidean
wrapper, a theorem-shaped alias, or a second local notation shell. The recall signatures below
match the upstream binder surface exactly. -/

/- Definition 3.1.5.1: the constrained subdifferential of an extended-real-valued function `f`
at a point `x₀` relative to a set `Q` is the canonical set `constrainedSubdifferential Q f x₀`,
written `∂[Q] f(x₀)`, consisting of all vectors whose affine support inequality holds for every
`y ∈ Q`, with `x₀` itself lying in `Q ∩ dom f`. -/
