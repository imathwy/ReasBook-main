open scoped ConvexAnalysis SupportFunction

/- Theorem 3.17 lies in the chapter's support-function comparison domain.

Primary domain:
- support functions of closed convex subsets of a real Hilbert space.

Relevant sampled owner declarations:
- `supportFunction` in `Definition_3_9`, the chapter owner for `ξ[Q]`;
- `extendedRealEffectiveDomain` / `dom` in `Definition_3_1_1_2`, the owner of the finite-value
  domain of an `EReal`-valued function;
- `supportFunction_apply` in `Definition_3_9`, the evaluation bridge for `ξ[Q]`;
- mathlib `geometric_hahn_banach_closed_point`, the strict point-versus-closed-convex separation
  theorem whose dual functional is converted to a vector normal by Riesz representation.

Best owner abstraction:
- the pair `ξ[Q]` and `dom ξ[Q]`.

Primitive data:
- the sets `Q₁`, `Q₂`.

Derived API:
- the support-function comparison theorem `subset_of_supportFunction_le_on_domain`;
- the equality criterion `supportFunction_eq_on_common_domain_implies_eq`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook comparison and equality criteria for closed convex sets via support
  functions;
- core/canonical: the owner constructions `supportFunction` and `dom`;
- bridge/view: these two theorems, which express the source comparison statements directly in that
  owner language instead of introducing a parallel local wrapper.

The textbook states these results on `ℝⁿ`. The comparison theorems themselves still live directly
on the owner pair `ξ[Q]`, `dom ξ[Q]`, but their intrinsic ambient layer is a real Hilbert space:
the proof needs a separating continuous linear functional to be represented by a vector normal in
the same space. This completeness requirement is therefore mathematical owner data here, not mere
proof scaffolding. -/

/-- Theorem 3.17 (1): if `Q₂` is a nonempty closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space and
the support function of `Q₁` is bounded above by that of `Q₂` at every vector in `dom ξ[Q₂]`,
then `Q₁ ⊆ Q₂`. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `Q₁ = ∅`, the conclusion is immediate. Otherwise argue by contradiction. For
-- `x₀ ∈ Q₁ \\ Q₂`, use the separation theorem for the point `x₀` and the nonempty closed convex
-- set `Q₂` to produce a vector `g` with `supportFunction Q₂ g` finite and
-- `supportFunction Q₂ g < supportFunction Q₁ g`, contradicting the assumed pointwise inequality
-- on `dom ξ[Q₂]`.

/-- Theorem 3.17 (2): if two closed convex sets in a real Hilbert space have the same
effective domain for their support functions and those support functions agree on that common
domain, then the sets are equal. -/
-- Proof sketch: equality of effective domains rules out the mixed empty/nonempty case for `Q₁`
-- and `Q₂`. If both sets are empty, the conclusion is immediate. Otherwise the common domain is
-- nonempty, so both sets are nonempty; apply `subset_of_supportFunction_le_on_domain` in both
-- directions. The domain equality transports the equality hypothesis from one set to the other,
-- giving both inclusions and hence equality.
