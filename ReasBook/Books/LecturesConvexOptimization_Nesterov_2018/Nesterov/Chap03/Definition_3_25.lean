variable {n m : ℕ}

/- Definition 3.25 is a source-facing recall in the constrained-optimization domain of owner
predicates on `GeneralMinimizationProblem n m`.

Primary mathematical domain:
* smooth inequality-constrained minimization on a closed convex feasible set

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `problem.IsSmooth` in `Definition_1_1_4_3`
* `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem` in `Definition_1_10_21`
* `problem.HasLeConstraints` in `Definition_1_1_1`
* `problem.constraintVector_continuous_iff` in `Definition_1_10_21`

Best owner abstraction:
* `GeneralMinimizationProblem n m`, with the owner smoothness predicate `problem.IsSmooth` and
  the source-facing feasible-set hypotheses expressed directly on `problem.basicFeasibleSet`

Primitive data:
* the owner problem `problem`
* the smoothness hypothesis `problem.IsSmooth`
* the inequality-sense hypothesis `problem.HasLeConstraints`
* closedness and convexity of `problem.basicFeasibleSet`

Derived API:
* objective continuity from `problem.IsSmooth`
* scalar-constraint continuity from `problem.constraintVector_continuous_iff` together with
  `problem.IsSmooth`
* the bundled Chapter 1 bridge `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem`, recovered by
  `smoothFunctionalConstraintProblem_iff`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Definition 3.25 as `problem.IsSmooth`, `problem.HasLeConstraints`, and
  closed-convex geometry of `problem.basicFeasibleSet`
* core/canonical: the owner problem together with its Chapter 1 smoothness predicate
  `problem.IsSmooth`
* bridge/view: the companion equivalence that repackages the source-facing hypothesis list as the
  bundled Chapter 1 predicate `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem`

This file therefore keeps no parallel `IsSmoothFunctionalConstraintProblem` wrapper. Downstream
usage should use the source-facing owner expression directly, and only use the package bridge when
that bundled Chapter 1 API is specifically needed. -/
