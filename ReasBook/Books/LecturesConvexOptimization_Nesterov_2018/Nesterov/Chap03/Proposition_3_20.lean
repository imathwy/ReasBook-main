/- Proposition 3.20 lies in the chapter's dual-norm / subdifferential domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `supportFunction` and `supportFunction_apply` from `Definition_3_9`, the chapter owner for
  support functions;
- `Seminorm.dualNorm` and `Seminorm.dualNorm_apply` from `Definition_3_20`, the chapter recall of
  the dual-norm owner;
- `IsSubgradientAt`, `subdifferential`, and `mem_subdifferential_iff` from `Definition_3_1_5`, the
  chapter owners for extended-valued subgradients;
- `Seminorm.closedConvexFunction` from `Proposition_3_6` and
  `isGreatest_pairing_image_subdifferential_zero_of_convex_posHomogeneous` from
  `Proposition_3_19`, the upstream Chapter 3 owners that make the support-function statement a
  consequence of convexity plus positive homogeneity rather than a standalone duplicate duality
  theorem.

Best owner abstraction:
- `ξ[Q]` for the support function of a set `Q`;
- `Seminorm.dualNorm p` for the dual norm;
- `∂ f(x)` for the subdifferential statement.

Primitive data:
- a seminorm `p : Seminorm ℝ E`;
- the ambient real inner-product-space structure on `E`;
- the separation hypothesis `[p.IsNorm]` only for the dual-norm formulas;
- finite-dimensionality only for the source-facing dual-ball reformulations and for the
  finite-dimensional owner theorem identifying `p` with the support function of `∂p(0)`.

Derived API:
- the intrinsic origin-subdifferential formula for the lifted real-valued seminorm, derived
  directly from `mem_subdifferential_iff`;
- the owner-level support-function formula for `p` against its origin subdifferential;
- the source-facing dual-unit-ball reformulations of those two intrinsic statements.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the dual-unit-ball support-function and origin-subdifferential formulas;
- core/canonical: `subdifferential` together with the owner-level support-function statement on
  `∂ (fun y ↦ (p y : WithTop ℝ))(0)`;
- bridge/view: the intrinsic inequality description `{g | ∀ y, inner ℝ g y ≤ p y}` and its
  finite-dimensional dual-ball reformulation `{g | ‖g‖[p,*] ≤ 1}`.

This refinement removes the duplicate local effective-domain and subgradient API and rewrites the
proposition directly in the chapter owner vocabulary. The support-function part now passes first
through the canonical Chapter 3 owner `∂ (fun y ↦ (p y : WithTop ℝ))(0)`, so the finite-dimensional
source-facing dual-ball statement is only a bridge theorem rather than a second root description.
For the subdifferential part, the intrinsic inequality characterization `∀ y, ⟪g, y⟫ ≤ p y` is
the mathematically sound bridge on an arbitrary real inner-product space, while the closed dual
unit ball remains the finite-dimensional source-facing reformulation that additionally uses
`[p.IsNorm]`. -/
