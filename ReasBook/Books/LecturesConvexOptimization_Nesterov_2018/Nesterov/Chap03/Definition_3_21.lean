/- Definition 3.21 lies in the source-facing domain of composite convex minimization.

Primary domain:
- composite convex minimization with a smooth real-valued term and an extended-valued closed
  convex regularizer on a common feasible set, generalized from the textbook `ℝⁿ` model to the
  intrinsic ambient-space owner level.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` from `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the Chapter 1 owner of a
  feasible set together with one real-valued objective;
- `ConvexC1On` from `Chap02/Definition_2_4`, the chapter owner for a real-valued smooth convex
  term on a feasible set;
- `ClosedConvexOn` from `Definition_3_1_1_5`, the chapter owner predicate for an
  `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued term on a feasible set;
- `CompositeLipschitzGradientModel` from `Chap06/Definition_6_8`, which reuses the same helper
  `compositeObjective` for the full composite objective once the smooth term and regularizer are
  fixed.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing owner: `CompositeConvexMinimizationProblem`;
- core/canonical ambient owner: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`;
- canonical chapter owner for the smooth term: `ConvexC1On`;
- canonical chapter predicate for the nonsmooth term: `ClosedConvexOn`;
- derived source-facing objective: the full extended-valued composite objective `x ↦ f x + Ψ x`.

Primitive data:
- the ambient feasible set `Q` and smooth term `f : E → ℝ`, owned canonically by
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`;
- the closedness of `Q`;
- the canonical smooth-owner witness `ConvexC1On Q f`;
- the nonsmooth term `Ψ` together with its `ClosedConvexOn Q Ψ` witness.

Derived API:
- the source-facing view `smoothPart`, recovered from the inherited owner objective;
- the smooth convexity and `C¹` regularity projections recovered from `ConvexC1On`;
- the convexity of `Q`, derived from `ClosedConvexOn.convex`;
- the coercion to the full composite objective `x ↦ f x + Ψ x`;
- the coercion from a problem to that composite objective.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `CompositeConvexMinimizationProblem`
- core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, `ClosedConvexOn`
- bridge/view: the inherited ambient owner projection is available when only the smooth subproblem
  is needed, but it is not the public mathematical content of Definition 3.21. -/

/-- Definition 3.21, generalized from the textbook `ℝⁿ` setting: a composite convex
minimization problem consists of a closed feasible set `Q`, a smooth convex part `f` that
belongs to `ConvexC1On Q`, and a closed convex term `Ψ` on `Q`, representing the objective
`x ↦ f x + Ψ x` minimized over `Q`. The ambient smooth pair `(Q, f)` is owned canonically by
`SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, the smooth regularity/convexity package by `ConvexC1On`,
and the nonsmooth term by `ClosedConvexOn`. The textbook `ℝⁿ` case is the specialization
`CompositeConvexMinimizationProblem (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))`. -/
