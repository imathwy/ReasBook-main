Definition 3.19 is a recall-only bridge in the chapter's extended-valued positive-homogeneity API.

Primary domain:
- positive homogeneity for `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions via their effective domains.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn` in `Definition_3_1_7`, the chapter owner for positive homogeneity on
  a cone;
- `dom` and `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter bridge from `WithTop ℝ` values to
  the effective-domain real part;
- `euler_homogeneous_function_theorem` in `Theorem_3_1_21`;
- `subgradient_inner_eq_degree_mul_withTopRealPart_of_homogeneous` in `Theorem_3_26`.

Best owner abstraction:
- `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn p (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)`.

Primitive data:
- an extended-real-valued function `f : E → WithTop ℝ`;
- a degree `p : ℝ`.

Derived API:
- closure of `dom f` under nonnegative scaling;
- the scaling law for `withTopRealPart f` on `dom f`;
- the downstream homogeneous-subgradient theorems in `Theorem_3_1_21` and `Theorem_3_26`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Definition 3.19's positive homogeneity on the effective domain of an
  `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function;
- core/canonical: `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn`;
- bridge/view: `dom f` and `withTopRealPart f`.

The previous file recalled only the raw generic owner and thereby dropped the chapter's canonical
effective-domain specialization already used downstream. This file now recalls the source-facing
bridge directly.

The source writes the side condition `0 ≤ p`. That inequality is not primitive owner data in this
project: the owner already restricts scaling parameters to `τ : NNReal`, and `Real.rpow (τ : ℝ) p`
is defined for every real exponent on that nonnegative base. The canonical notion is therefore the
specialized predicate below; later results can keep `0 ≤ p` as a separate theorem hypothesis when
the mathematics genuinely uses it.
