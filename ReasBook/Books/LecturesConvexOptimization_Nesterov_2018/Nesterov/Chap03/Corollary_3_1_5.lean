open scoped ConvexAnalysis SupportFunction

/- Corollary 3.1.5 belongs to the chapter's support-function comparison domain.

Primary domain:
- support functions of subsets of a real inner-product space and the extended-real effective
  domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
- `extendedRealEffectiveDomain` / `dom`
- `supportFunction`
- `subset_of_supportFunction_le_on_domain`
- `supportFunction_eq_on_common_domain_implies_eq`

Best owner abstraction:
- the support-function comparison theorem pair from `Theorem_3_17`, organized over the primitive
  data `supportFunction Q` and `dom ξ[Q]`

Source-facing layer:
- the textbook inclusion and equality criteria for closed convex sets stated via support-function
  comparison on the finite-value domain.

Core/canonical layer:
- `subset_of_supportFunction_le_on_domain`
- `supportFunction_eq_on_common_domain_implies_eq`

Bridge/view:
- none; this file only recalls the owner theorems.

Primitive data:
- `supportFunction Q`
- `dom ξ[Q]`

Derived API:
- inclusion from support-function comparison on the finite-value domain
- equality from agreement on the common finite-value domain

This file therefore keeps no parallel local support-function or effective-domain wrapper, and
recalls the chapter owner theorems directly at the intrinsic real Hilbert-space layer rather than
only at the concrete `ℝⁿ` specialization. -/

`Theorem_3_17`. -/

functions on their common finite-value domain; the shared-domain hypothesis already handles the
