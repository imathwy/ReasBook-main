variable (f : E → ℝ) (xStar : E)

/- Definition 3.33 lies in the unconstrained convex minimization domain on `ℝⁿ`.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* mathlib `ConvexOn`, the canonical owner predicate for convexity of a real-valued objective on a
  set, specialized here to `Set.univ`;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.unconstrained` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project
  owner for whole-space minimization problems;
* mathlib `IsMinOn` and `isMinOn_univ_iff`, the canonical owner and textbook bridge for global
  minimizers on `Set.univ`;
* mathlib `IsMinOn.isGLB` and `IsGLB.csInf_eq`, the attained-infimum bridge for the minimum value
  over the whole range.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: a whole-space convex objective on `ℝⁿ`;
* core/canonical: `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ f` together with
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.unconstrained f`;
* bridge/view: the attained-infimum theorem `isMinOn_iff_eq_sInf_range`.

Primitive data:
* the ambient objective `f : E → ℝ` for the source-facing definition;
* for the bridge theorem, only a function into an order type.

Derived API:
* the whole-space convexity predicate `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ f`;
* the ambient minimization-problem owner `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.unconstrained f`;
* the generic order-theoretic minimum-value identity on `Set.range f`.

This file therefore deletes the duplicate local wrapper
`UnconstrainedConvexMinimizationProblem`: its primitive objective data are already owned by the
Chapter 1 unconstrained minimization owner, while convexity itself is already owned canonically by
`ConvexOn`. The remaining theorem is a genuine bridge from whole-space minimality to the attained
infimum of the range, and it lives at the generic order owner layer because its proof does not use
Euclidean or real-specific structure. -/
