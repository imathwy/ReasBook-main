Primary domain: projected first-order subgradient methods for convex minimization over a simple
closed convex feasible set.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `FirstOrderConvexMinimizationProblem` in `Definition_3_40` for the ambient feasible set,
  convex objective, and first-order oracle;
- `FirstOrderConvexMinimizationProblem.projection` and
  `FirstOrderConvexMinimizationProblem.projection_mem` in `Definition_3_40` for the canonical
  Euclidean projection back to the feasible set;
- `normalize` for the canonical normalized direction `g / ‖g‖`, taken to be `0` when `g = 0`;
- `FirstOrderConvexMinimizationProblem.normalizedSubgradientStep` in `Definition_3_40` for the
  owner projected normalized oracle step.

Owner abstraction:
- `FirstOrderConvexMinimizationProblem E`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- `source-facing`: `IsAdmissibleSubgradientStepsizeSequence`, `SimpleSetSubgradientMethod`, and
  the recursive iterate sequence `iterates`;
- `core/canonical`: the owner one-step map
  `FirstOrderConvexMinimizationProblem.normalizedSubgradientStep`;
- `bridge/view`: the recursion clause of `iterates`, exposed by `iterates_succ`, which applies the
  owner step along the method's time-dependent stepsizes.

Primitive data:
- a feasible starting point `x₀`;
- a raw stepsize sequence.

Derived API:
- the owner normalized projected step;
- the iterate sequence and its feasibility.
- the separate admissibility predicate on the raw stepsize sequence.

Accordingly, this file keeps only the source-facing extra algorithm data and derives the ambient
feasible set, objective, and oracle from the owner problem rather than duplicating that package
locally; it also keeps the public API centered on the recursive iterate sequence instead of adding
a redundant method-specific wrapper around the owner one-step map. Admissibility of the stepsizes
is tracked separately by `IsAdmissibleSubgradientStepsizeSequence method.stepsize` rather than
being packaged as primitive run data. -/

/-- Algorithm 3.2: a simple-set subgradient method for minimizing `f` over a simple closed convex
set `Q` consists of a feasible starting point `x₀` and a stepsize sequence; the objective,
feasible set, and first-order oracle are inherited from the owner first-order convex minimization
problem. The output sequence is the recursively defined iteration obtained by applying the owner
normalized subgradient step with stepsize `h_k` at the current iterate, i.e.
`x_{k+1} = π_Q (x_k - h_k • (g(x_k) / ‖g(x_k)‖))`, where `g(x_k)` is the owner-oracle subgradient
at `x_k`. The textbook admissibility conditions on `(h_k)` are recorded separately by
`IsAdmissibleSubgradientStepsizeSequence`. -/
