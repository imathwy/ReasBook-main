/- Theorem 3.1.5.6 lies in the chapter's extended-valued convex-analysis / subdifferential domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `IsSubgradientAt`
- `subdifferential`
- `mem_subdifferential_iff`
- `isMinOn_iff`

Best owner abstraction:
- the subdifferential owner `subdifferential`, derived from `IsSubgradientAt`
- the minimizer owner `IsMinOn`

Primitive data:
- a feasible set `Q`, an extended-real objective `f`, points `x0`, `xStar`, `g`
- the feasibility hypothesis `hx0 : x0 ∈ Q`
- the minimizing hypothesis `hxStar : IsMinOn f Q xStar`
- the owner-membership hypothesis `hg : g ∈ ∂ f(x0)`

Derived API:
- `x0 ∈ dom f`, extracted from `hg`
- `xStar ∈ dom f`, extracted from `hxStar` and `hg`
- the real inequality obtained by comparing the subgradient lower-support bound with the minimizer
  inequality

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the minimizer-pairing theorem stated in the textbook
- core/canonical: `subdifferential` / `IsSubgradientAt` and `IsMinOn`
- bridge/view: the passage from `IsMinOn f Q xStar` to the sublevel inequality `f xStar ≤ f x0`

The textbook states the result on `ℝⁿ`, but the theorem itself only uses the inner-product-space
owner abstractions. This file therefore removes the unnecessary Euclidean wrapper and proves the
source-facing statement directly from the canonical owner data. -/

/-- Theorem 3.1.5.6: if `xStar` minimizes `f` on `Q` and `x0 ∈ Q`, then every subgradient
`g ∈ ∂f(x0)` has nonnegative pairing with the displacement `x0 - xStar`. -/
-- Proof sketch: extract the owner subgradient inequality from `hg` and evaluate it at `xStar`.
-- Since `xStar` minimizes `f` on `Q` and `x0 ∈ Q`, we have `f xStar ≤ f x0`, so the owner
-- sublevel-set inequality applies directly at `xStar`.
