/- Definition 3.1.2.1 is a `bridge/view` recall in the chapter's Fenchel-conjugacy domain.

Primary domain:
- Fenchel conjugates of `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions on real inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- project `fenchelConjugate`
- project `fenchelConjugate_apply`
- mathlib `innerₗ`
- mathlib `innerₗ_apply_apply`

Best owner abstraction:
- the source-facing owner `fenchelDual`

Primitive data:
- `f : E → WithTop ℝ`

Derived API:
- the source-facing notation `f⋆`
- the definitional supremum formula `fenchelDual_apply`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook Fenchel conjugate for `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions
- core/canonical: `fenchelConjugate`
- bridge/view: the canonical coercion `((↑) : WithTop ℝ → EReal)` together with
  evaluation at `innerₗ E s`

Definition 3.1.2.1 is source-facing only after specializing the dual-space owner to the
`WithTop ℝ` setting and then viewing vectors as dual functionals through `innerₗ`. The textbook
`ℝⁿ` statement is the specialization `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. This file therefore owns the
reusable source-facing bridge `fenchelDual`, equips it with the textbook notation `f⋆`, and
derives the supremum formula from the canonical owner evaluation theorem.
