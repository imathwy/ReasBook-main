open scoped ConstrainedArgmin

/- Definition 3.36 lies in the constrained convex minimization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the Chapter 1 owner for the
  feasible-set / objective data of a minimization problem;
* `constrainedArgmin` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the canonical
  owner of optimal-solution membership on a feasible set;
* `subdifferentialWithin` and `mem_subdifferentialWithin_iff` in `Chap03/Theorem_3_44`, the
  real-valued feasible-subgradient surface already owned upstream in the chapter;
* `LinearEqualityConstrainedConvexProblem` in `Chap03/Definition_3_27`, the nearby chapter owner
  pattern where the ambient optimization data are inherited from an upstream owner and only the
  genuinely extra convex-program hypotheses remain primitive.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `ConvexMinimizationProblem X`;
* core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem X`, `argmin[Q] f`, and the chapter's
  constrained-subdifferential owners;
* bridge/view: `objective_convexOn`.

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `Q` and the real-valued objective `f`, already owned by
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem X`;
* the nonemptiness, closedness, and convexity of `Q`;
* the whole-space convexity witness `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ f`.

Derived API:
* the coercion back to the inherited Chapter 1 owner;
* the feasible-set convexity owner `problem.objective_convexOn`.

This file therefore keeps the source-facing problem class, but its optimality and subgradient
surfaces are the upstream owners `x ∈ argmin[problem.feasibleSet] problem` and, in downstream
real-valued inner-product settings, `g ∈ ∂[problem.feasibleSet] problem(x)` rather than parallel
local aliases. -/
