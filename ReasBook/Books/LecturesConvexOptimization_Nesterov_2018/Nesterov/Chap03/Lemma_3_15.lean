/- Lemma 3.15 is the chapter's real-valued bridge over the upstream `WithTop`-valued
subdifferential owner.

Primary domain:
- real-valued subdifferentials of positively homogeneous functions.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `IsSubgradientAt` and `subdifferential` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the chapter owner for
  subgradients, already stated on `E → WithTop ℝ`;
- `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn` in `Definition_3_1_7`, the chapter owner for positive homogeneity;
- `subdifferential_eq_subdifferential_zero_touching_of_convex_oneHomogeneous` in
  `Lemma_3_1_15`, an earlier Euclidean real-valued restatement of the same source fact with a
  redundant convexity hypothesis;
- `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff_exists_subgradient_nonneg_pairing` in `Theorem_3_1_24`, an existing
  downstream use of the canonical owner on the real-to-`WithTop` coercion.

Best owner abstraction:
- primitive predicate `IsSubgradientAt` from `Definition_3_1_5`, specialized to
  `fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ)`;
- derived set-valued owner `subdifferential` from `Definition_3_1_5`;
- `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn 1 Set.univ f` for the positive-homogeneity input to Lemma 3.15.

Primitive data:
- the affine lower-support predicate `IsSubgradientAt (fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ))`;
- the positive-homogeneity owner hypothesis.

Internal bridge:
- the coercion lemma identifying the owner predicate with the usual real-valued inequality.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Lemma 3.15's description of `∂f(x)` for one-homogeneous real-valued `f`;
- core/canonical: `IsSubgradientAt`, `subdifferential`, `IsPositivelyHomogeneousOn`;
- bridge/view: `mem_subdifferential_coe_real_iff`, the owner-level real-valued coercion bridge
  from `Definition_3_1_5`.

This file therefore stops duplicating the real-valued subgradient owner. Its public API keeps only
the source-facing Lemma 3.15 statement and reuses the owner-level real-valued bridge from
`Definition_3_1_5` instead of carrying a private copy.

/-- Lemma 3.15: for a positively `1`-homogeneous function on a real inner-product space,
the subdifferential at `x` is exactly the intersection of the origin subdifferential with the
touching condition `⟪g, x⟫ = f x`. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `g ∈ ∂f(x)`, apply the subgradient inequality at `0` and at `2 • x`; positive
-- homogeneity gives the two opposite inequalities needed for `⟪g, x⟫ = f x`, and then the same
-- supporting inequality shows `g ∈ ∂f(0)`. Conversely, if `g ∈ ∂f(0)` and `⟪g, x⟫ = f x`,
-- rewrite the support inequality at `0` to obtain the support inequality at `x`. No convexity
-- hypothesis is needed once the owner subgradient inequality is used directly.
