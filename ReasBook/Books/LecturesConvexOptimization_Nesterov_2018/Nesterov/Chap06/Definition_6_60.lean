/- Definition 6.60 lies in the Chapter 6 contracted conditional-gradient / total-variation
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `contractedFeasibleSet` in `Algorithm_6_5`, the chapter owner for the contracted feasible set
  `{(1 - τ) x + τ u | u ∈ Q}`;
- `linearModelTotalVariation` in `Definition_6_59`, the source-facing `EReal` owner for the total
  variation of the linear model at a feasible point;
- `linearModelTotalVariationReal` in `Definition_6_59`, the downstream finite-real-part bridge for
  real-valued estimates;
- `ConditionalGradientContraction.linearizedCompositeGap` in `Theorem_6_14`, the more general
  Chapter 6 extended-valued chosen-dual gap owner for the same contracted affine pattern.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `contractedLinearModelTotalVariation`;
- core/canonical: `linearModelTotalVariation (contractedFeasibleSet Q x τ) f Ψ`, evaluated at the
  canonical center point `x` of the contracted feasible set;
- bridge/view: the explicit expansion theorem below, and any later real-valued use should pass
  through the finite-real-part bridge rather than redefining a parallel owner.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q : Set E`;
- the smooth term `f` and regularizer `Ψ`;
- the contraction factor `τ : ℝ`;
- the feasible base point `x : Q`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing owner `contractedLinearModelTotalVariation`;
- the textbook Lean notation for `δ_τ(x)`;
- the defining `EReal`-valued supremum expansion over `u ∈ Q`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the contracted total variation of the linear model at `x`;
- core/canonical: `linearModelTotalVariation` on the contracted feasible set centered at `x`;
- bridge/view: the image-expansion theorem rewriting the contracted feasible-set supremum back to
  the textbook `u ∈ Q` parametrization.

This refinement keeps Definition 6.60 on the same `EReal`-valued owner family as
Definition 6.59. The previous collapse onto the ambient chosen-dual gap owner is removed:
the proof that `x` lies in its contracted feasible set stays internal, and only the source-facing
contracted specialization remains public here. Since the owner is just the total variation on
`contractedFeasibleSet Q x τ`, the contraction bounds `0 ≤ τ ≤ 1` belong in later results that
use them, not in this defining owner itself.

/-- Definition 6.60: the contracted total variation `δ_τ(x)` of the linear model at a feasible
point `x ∈ Q` is the total variation from Definition 6.59, specialized to the contracted feasible
set centered at `x`. It is therefore `EReal`-valued, remaining faithful even when the contracted
supremum is not bounded above in `ℝ`. -/
