Definition 6.4 lies in the constrained convex minimization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner of a
  feasible set together with a real-valued objective;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.optimalValue` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_7`, the canonical
  optimal-value owner for that ambient problem data;
* `LinearEqualityConstrainedConvexProblem` in `Chap03/Definition_3_27`, which extends the same
  owner and keeps only genuinely extra convex-program data as primitive fields;
* `Metric.isCompact_of_isClosed_isBounded`, together with `FiniteDimensional.proper_real`, the
  canonical bounded-to-compact bridge used only when the ambient space is finite-dimensional.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `PrimalConvexMinimizationProblem E`;
* core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E` and its owner `optimalValue`;
* bridge/view: the finite-dimensional compactness theorem for the feasible set.

Primitive data:
* the feasible set and objective, owned by `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E`;
* nonemptiness, boundedness, and closedness of the feasible set;
* continuity and convexity of the objective on the feasible set.

Derived API:
* coercion to the ambient objective;
* the inherited owner optimal-value API, available directly as `problem.optimalValue`;
* convexity of the feasible set, recovered canonically from `objective_convex`;
* compactness of the feasible set under the additional finite-dimensional ambient hypothesis.

/-- Definition 6.4: a primal convex minimization problem consists of a nonempty bounded closed
convex feasible set `Q₁` and a continuous convex objective function `f : E → ℝ`, considered on
`Q₁`. The textbook item specializes this data to finite-dimensional real ambient spaces. -/
