/- Definition 6.50 lies in the chapter's composite convex minimization / closed extended-valued
regularizer domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the base owner for a feasible
  set together with a real-valued objective;
- `PrimalConvexMinimizationProblem` in `Chap06/Definition_6_4`, the Chapter 6 owner obtained once
  nonemptiness, boundedness, closedness, continuity, and convexity are available for the smooth
  feasible-set problem;
- `withTopEffectiveDomain` / `dom` and `constrainedEpigraph` in `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the
  Chapter 3 owners for effective domains and epigraphs of `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions;
- `ClosedConvexFunction` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_1_5`, the chapter owner for a proper closed
  convex extended-valued term on its own effective domain;
- `_root_.compositeObjective` in `Chap03/Definition_3_21`, the canonical composite objective
  `x ↦ f x + Ψ x`.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `CompositeBoundedConvexMinimizationProblem`;
- core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, `PrimalConvexMinimizationProblem`,
  `ClosedConvexFunction`, and `_root_.compositeObjective`;
- bridge/view: the domain inclusion `dom Ψ ⊆ Q`, which forces the composite objective to take the
  value `⊤` outside `Q`, together with the derived bridge to
  `PrimalConvexMinimizationProblem`.

Primitive data:
- the ambient feasible set and smooth term, owned canonically by
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`;
- boundedness and closedness of `Q`;
- convexity of the smooth term on `Q`;
- differentiability of the inherited smooth part on `Q`;
- the extended-valued regularizer `Ψ`;
- properness of `Ψ`;
- the canonical closed-convex-function owner for `Ψ`;
- the source-facing inclusion `dom Ψ ⊆ Q`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing name `smoothPart` for the inherited real objective;
- nonemptiness of `Q`, obtained from `nonsmoothPart_proper` and `dom Ψ ⊆ Q`;
- continuity of `f` on `Q`, obtained from differentiability;
- the canonical Chapter 6 bridge `toPrimalConvexMinimizationProblem`;
- convexity and differentiability of `smoothPart` on `Q`;
- the extended composite objective `x ↦ f x + Ψ x`;
- the fact that `Ψ x = ⊤` and hence the composite objective is `⊤` outside `Q`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `CompositeBoundedConvexMinimizationProblem`;
- core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, `PrimalConvexMinimizationProblem`,
  `ClosedConvexFunction`, `_root_.compositeObjective`;
- bridge/view: `nonsmoothPart_domain_subset_feasibleSet`.

The previous version duplicated the Chapter 3 effective-domain, epigraph, and composite-objective
owners locally. This refinement keeps Definition 6.50 as its own source-facing owner, but moves
its primitive data onto the existing project owners, derives the ambient Chapter 6 feasible-set
owner instead of storing its redundant fields primitively, and deletes exact-interface aliases for
canonical notions. -/

/-- Definition 6.50: a composite bounded convex minimization problem consists of a nonempty
bounded closed convex feasible set `Q`, a convex differentiable smooth term `f` on `Q`, and a
proper closed convex extended-valued term `Ψ` whose effective domain is contained in `Q`. The
ambient smooth pair `(Q, f)` is owned canonically by `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`; the
nonemptiness of `Q` is derived from properness of `Ψ` together with `dom Ψ ⊆ Q`, and the ambient
Chapter 6 feasible-set owner is recovered by the bridge
`toPrimalConvexMinimizationProblem`. The regularizer uses the Chapter 3 owner
`ClosedConvexFunction`. -/
