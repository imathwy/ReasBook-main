/- Definition 7.50 lies in the chapter's real-valued concave-subdifferential domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `IsSubgradientAt` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_5`, the chapter owner for affine lower supports of
  `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions;
- `subdifferential` and the notation `∂ f(x)` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_5`, the derived set-valued
  owner API;
- `mem_subdifferential_coe_iff` in `Chap06/Definition_6_37`, the real-valued bridge from the
  Chapter 3 owner to the usual affine lower-support inequality;
- `dualAffineSupport_iff_isSubgradientAt` in `Chap07/Definition_7_7`, a nearby Chapter 7 bridge
  that also reuses `IsSubgradientAt` instead of rebuilding a parallel real-valued support owner.

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical: `IsSubgradientAt` and `∂` applied to the negated function `-f`;
- bridge/view: the sign change `g ↦ -g`, which turns concave upper supports for `f` into convex
  lower supports for `-f`.

Primitive data:
- a real-valued function `f : E → ℝ`;
- a base point `x : E`;
- a vector `g : E`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing concave-subgradient predicate;
- the source-facing concave subdifferential;
- the textbook affine upper-support equivalence.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `IsConcaveSubgradientAt` and `concaveSubdifferential`;
- core/canonical: `IsSubgradientAt` and `∂` for the negated function;
- bridge/view: `isConcaveSubgradientAt_iff` and `mem_concaveSubdifferential_iff`.

Definition 7.50 does introduce a source-facing concave notion, so this file should not collapse to
a bare recall. But the primitive inequality owner already exists upstream: a concave subgradient of
`f` is exactly a Chapter 3 subgradient of `-f` after the canonical sign flip `g ↦ -g`. The file
therefore keeps the Chapter 7 vocabulary only as a thin bridge layer over that owner abstraction,
instead of maintaining a second primitive affine-support definition.

/-- Definition 7.50: a vector `g` is a subgradient of a concave real-valued function `f` at `x`
when `-g` is a Chapter 3 subgradient of the convex function `-f` at `x`. Equivalently, `g` gives
the global affine upper support inequality for `f`. Since `f : E → ℝ`, the textbook domain
conditions `x ∈ dom f` and `y ∈ dom f` are automatic. -/
