local notation "Δₙ" => Δ[n]

/- Definition 7.40 lies in the finite simplex / simplex-saddle-point matrix-game domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `stdSimplex` and the Chapter 6 notation `Δ[n]` in `Chap06/Definition_6_11`, the canonical
  simplex owner;
- `SimplexSaddlePointProblem.primalObjective` in `Chap06/Definition_6_12`, the chapter owner for
  simplex max-type objectives of the form `x ↦ ⟪c, x⟫ + max_j {⟪a_j, x⟫ + b^(j)}`;
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.optimalValue` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_7`, the project
  owner for constrained optimal values.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the matrix-game payoff on the simplex `Δ[n]`;
- core/canonical: `SimplexSaddlePointProblem.primalObjective` for the zero-linear-term saddle
  problem with matrix `Aᵀ`, together with `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.optimalValue`;
- bridge/view: the specialization from a nonnegative matrix-game matrix `A` to that simplex
  saddle-point owner, and the whole-domain constrained problem on the simplex subtype.

Primitive data:
- the matrix `A : Matrix (Fin (n : ℕ)) (Fin (m : ℕ)) ℝ`.

Derived API:
- the specialized simplex saddle-point problem with zero linear terms;
- the simplex payoff function;
- its textbook coordinate formula `max_i ⟪a_i, x⟫`;
- the constrained optimal value over simplex points.

The previous file overextended the source-facing matrix-game payoff to arbitrary `m : ℕ` by
inserting a synthetic `m = 0` branch, and it introduced a separate raw real-valued infimum. This
refinement moves back to the chapter's positive simplex dimension layer `n m : ℕ+`, reuses the
earlier Chapter 6 simplex saddle-point owner for the payoff, and derives the value from the
Chapter 1 constrained minimization owner instead of rebuilding a parallel value API.
