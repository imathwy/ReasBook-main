/- Definition 5.4.6.1 lies in the chapter's cone-ordered second-derivative domain for
vector-valued `C³` maps.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `ConvexCone ℝ E₂`, the canonical owner for the ambient cone order;
* `ContDiffOn ℝ 3 ξ (interior Q₁)`, the canonical `C³` owner on the interior domain;
* `iteratedFDerivWithin ℝ 2 ξ (interior Q₁) x (fun _ ↦ h)`, the canonical second within-domain
  directional derivative expression;
* `IsBetaCompatibleWith` from `Definition_5_4_6_2`, the later owner in the same subsection that
  builds on this same derivative-level data.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `IsThreeTimesContDiffConcaveOnWith Q₁ K ξ`;
* core/canonical: mathlib's `ConvexCone`, `ContDiffOn`, and `iteratedFDerivWithin`;
* bridge/view: the class projections together with the inherited closedness instance for `K`.

Primitive data:
* the domain `Q₁`;
* the cone `K`;
* the map `ξ`;
* closedness and convexity of `Q₁`;
* closedness of `K`;
* `C³` regularity of `ξ` on `interior Q₁`;
* the cone-order second-derivative condition on `interior Q₁`.

Derived API:
* the field projections of `IsThreeTimesContDiffConcaveOnWith`;
* the canonical `Fact` instance supplying closedness of the cone owner `K`.

This keeps Definition 5.4.6.1 as the source-facing owner while deleting the exact-interface local
wrapper around `iteratedFDerivWithin`. Closedness of the cone is carried through the canonical
`ConvexCone` owner instead of remaining a parallel primitive projection. -/

/-- Definition 5.4.6.1: a map `ξ : Q₁ → E₂` is three times continuously differentiable and
concave with respect to the closed convex cone `K` when `Q₁` is a closed convex set, `K` is
closed, `ξ` is `C^3` on `interior Q₁`, and `-D²ξ(x)[h,h]` belongs to `K` for every
`x ∈ interior Q₁` and every direction `h`. -/
