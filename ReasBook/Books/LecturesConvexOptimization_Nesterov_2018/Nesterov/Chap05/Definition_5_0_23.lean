/- Definition 5.0.23 lies in the chapter's self-concordant minimization domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner of a
  feasible set together with a real-valued objective;
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith` and `IsSelfConcordantOn` in `Chap05/Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter
  owners for quantitative and existential self-concordance on a domain;
* `ContinuousLinearMap.IsPositive` in mathlib, the canonical pointwise positivity owner for
  symmetric continuous linear operators on real inner-product spaces;
* `hessian` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, reused upstream by the self-concordance owner as the
  canonical Hessian operator.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `UnconstrainedSelfConcordantMinimizationProblem E`;
* core/canonical ambient owner: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E`;
* core/canonical regularity owner:
  `IsSelfConcordantOnWith feasibleSet selfConcordanceConstant objective`;
* auxiliary reusable property: `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn feasibleSet objective`.

Primitive data:
* the feasible set and objective, owned by `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E`;
* a self-concordance constant for the objective on the feasible set;
* quantitative self-concordance of the objective on the feasible set;
* pointwise positivity and strict positive definiteness of the Hessian on the feasible set.

Derived API:
* openness and convexity of the feasible set, recovered from self-concordance;
* the qualitative self-concordance view `IsSelfConcordantOn feasibleSet objective`;
* the coercion to the ambient objective function;
* the inherited ambient owner projection `toSetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `UnconstrainedSelfConcordantMinimizationProblem E`;
* core/canonical:
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E`,
  `IsSelfConcordantOnWith feasibleSet selfConcordanceConstant objective`;
* bridge/view: the inherited parent projection when only the ambient minimization owner is
  needed. -/

/-- Definition 5.0.23, generalized from the textbook Euclidean setting: an unconstrained
self-concordant minimization problem consists of a domain and an objective to be minimized over
that domain, where the objective is self-concordant on the domain and has positive definite
Hessian there. The ambient problem data are owned canonically by
`SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, while self-concordance is expressed through the chapter owner
`IsSelfConcordantOnWith`. -/
