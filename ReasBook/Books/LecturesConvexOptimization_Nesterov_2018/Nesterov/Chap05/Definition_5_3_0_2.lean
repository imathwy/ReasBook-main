-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

universe u

/- Definition 5.3.0.2 lies in the chapter's `WithTop ℝ` convex-analysis domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `withTopEffectiveDomain` / `dom` from `Chap03/Definition_3_3`
- `extendedRealEffectiveDomain` / `dom` from `Chap03/Definition_3_1_1_2`
- mathlib `closure`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the textbook notation `Dom f`
- core/canonical: `closure (dom f)`
- bridge/view: the scoped notation declaration below

Primitive data:
- the effective domain owner `dom f`
- the topological closure operator

Derived API:
- `mem_Dom_iff`
- `dom_subset_Dom`

This item is only a source-facing notation bridge. Since `closure (dom f)` is already the exact
canonical owner, the refinement keeps no parallel alias for it and exposes only the notation and
its atomic bridge lemmas. -/
