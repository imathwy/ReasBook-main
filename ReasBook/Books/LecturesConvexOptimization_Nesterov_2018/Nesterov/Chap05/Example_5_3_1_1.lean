open scoped Gradient

noncomputable section

/- Example 5.3.1.1 lies in the Chapter 5 self-concordant-barrier / affine-objective domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` in `Definition_5_3_2`, the chapter owner for
  `ν`-self-concordant barriers;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith.barrier_parameter_bound`, the primitive owner inequality used to
  contradict barrierhood on `Set.univ`;
* `quadraticAffineObjective` in `Example_5_1_2`, the chapter source-facing owner for affine-
  quadratic objectives;
* `quadraticAffineObjective_gradient_eq` and `quadraticAffineObjective_hessian_eq`, the canonical
  differential API for that owner.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the scalar affine function `x ↦ α + a x`;
* core/canonical: `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith`;
* bridge/view: the zero-Hessian specialization
  `quadraticAffineObjective α a (0 : ℝ →L[ℝ] ℝ)`.

Primitive data:
* the scalar offset `α`;
* the nonzero slope `a`;
* the barrier parameter `ν`.

Derived API:
* the affine-quadratic owner view of `x ↦ α + a x`;
* the constant gradient formula `∇f(x) = a`;
* the vanishing Hessian formula `∇²f(x) = 0`.

This refinement keeps the theorem source-facing, but removes the ad hoc differential computation
route in favor of the existing affine-quadratic owner and the primitive barrier-owner inequality. -/

-- Proof sketch: if `f x = α + a * x` were a `ν`-self-concordant barrier on `ℝ`, then the
-- barrier-parameter inequality from `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` would read `2 * a * u ≤ ν`
-- for every direction `u : ℝ` because the Hessian vanishes identically. Taking `u` with the same
-- sign as `a` and arbitrarily large magnitude contradicts this when `a ≠ 0`.
/-- Example 5.3.1.1: the affine function `x ↦ α + a x` on all of `ℝ` is not a
`ν`-self-concordant barrier whenever `a ≠ 0`. In particular, the nonconstant linear
specialization `x ↦ a x` cannot be a self-concordant barrier because its Hessian is zero. -/
