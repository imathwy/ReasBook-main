/- Definition 5.1.1 lies in the chapter's self-concordance / Hessian-local-norm domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `hessian` from `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the intrinsic second-order owner used throughout the
  chapter;
* `thirdDirectionalDerivative` from `Definition_5_0_10`, the canonical cubic-derivative owner;
* `ConvexOn` from mathlib, the canonical owner for convexity on a fixed domain;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` from `Definition_5_3_2`, the downstream barrier owner that
  extends the standard-self-concordant case defined here.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom Mf f`, the textbook bundled notion carrying the
  constant `M_f`;
* core/canonical: the Hessian owner `hessian f x`, the local norm owner `‖u‖[f; x]`, and the
  convexity owner `ConvexOn ℝ dom f`;
* bridge/view: the derived qualitative abbreviation `IsSelfConcordantOn dom f` and the standard
  specialization `IsStandardSelfConcordantOn dom f`.

Primitive data:
* the domain `dom`;
* the self-concordance constant `Mf`;
* the function `f`;
* openness of `dom`, `C³` regularity of `f` on `dom`, convexity on `dom`, and the cubic
  third-derivative bound.

Derived API:
* the local norm notation `‖u‖[f; x]`;
* domain convexity and Hessian positivity/semidefiniteness on `dom`;
* the qualitative and standard-self-concordant specializations.

This file keeps the quantitative owner as the public core. The qualitative and standard forms stay
as thin source-facing views, while Hessian positivity is exposed through inferable theorem-level
API rather than through an extra `Fact` wrapper around the defining class field. -/
