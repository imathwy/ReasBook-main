/-
Definition 3.70 is a recall-only item in the chapter's real-valued convex-analysis /
subdifferential domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `subdifferential` and `mem_subdifferential_iff` in `Definition_3_1_5`
- `convexDirectionalDerivativeReal_isGreatest_subgradientPairing_of_mem_interior` in
  `Theorem_3_21`
- `isGreatest_inner_image_spdEllipsoid` in `Lemma_3_20`
- `IsGreatest.csSup_eq` in mathlib, the canonical bridge from explicit maximum attainment to the
  corresponding supremum equality

Best owner abstraction in this file:
- source-facing: the textbook maximum-attainment statement for `M_f`
- core/canonical: the pointwise owner `∂ (fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ))(x)` together with the
  ambient order owner `IsGreatest`
- bridge/view: none; the one-off norm-set comprehension is inlined directly into the
  `IsGreatest` statement

Primitive data:
- the pointwise subdifferentials `subdifferential (fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ)) x`

Public derived API:
- none in this recall file

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook maximum-attainment statement for `M_f`
- core/canonical: `subdifferential` and `IsGreatest`
- bridge/view: the inlined set of attainable subgradient norms inside the checked statement

There is no earlier chapter owner for the whole textbook constant `M_f`. This file therefore keeps
the source-facing maximum statement directly as a checked `IsGreatest` proposition, deletes the
one-off public norm-set wrapper, and leaves the supremum reformulation to the canonical generic
companion `hM_f.csSup_eq`. Because the checked statement only uses the subdifferential owner
`∂ (fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ))(x)` from `Definition_3_1_5` and the ambient norm `‖g‖`, its
public ambient assumptions stay on the same seminormed inner-product layer as that owner.

variable (Q : Set E) (f : E → ℝ) (M_f : ℝ)

/- Definition 3.70: the textbook constant `M_f` is the maximum of the norms `‖g‖` of all
subgradients `g ∈ ∂f(x)` with `x ∈ Q`; in Lean this is the canonical maximum-attainment predicate
on the direct set of attainable subgradient norms. -/
