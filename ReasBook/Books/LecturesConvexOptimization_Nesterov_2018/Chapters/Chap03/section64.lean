/- Definition 3.64 lies in the constrained convex optimization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `linftyLipschitzClass` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_4`, the Chapter 1 source-facing fixed-parameter
  Lipschitz class on functions;
- `S0On` and the notation `𝒮^0_μ(Q)` in `Chap03/Definition_3_47`, the nearby chapter pattern for
  a fixed-parameter function class with small projection lemmas;
- mathlib `ConvexOn`, the canonical owner predicate for convexity on a feasible set;
- mathlib `LipschitzOnWith`, the canonical owner predicate for a fixed Lipschitz bound on a
  feasible set.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the textbook fixed-parameter function class `𝓕_M^{0,0}(Q)`, written on Lean
  theorem surfaces as `𝓕⁰⁰[M](Q)`;
- core/canonical: `ConvexOn ℝ Q f` and `LipschitzOnWith M f Q`;
- bridge/view: the membership/accessor lemmas exposing those two canonical predicates directly.

Primitive data:
- a feasible set `Q`;
- a Lipschitz parameter `M`;
- an objective `f : E → ℝ`.

Derived API:
- source-facing membership `f ∈ 𝓕⁰⁰[M](Q)`;
- the canonical convexity and Lipschitz owner predicates recovered from membership;
- the constructor theorem from the canonical pair back to the source-facing class.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `f ∈ 𝓕⁰⁰[M](Q)`;
- core/canonical: `ConvexOn ℝ Q f` and `LipschitzOnWith M f Q`;
- bridge/view: `mem_F00_iff`, `ConvexLipschitzOn.convexOn`,
  `ConvexLipschitzOn.lipschitzOnWith`, and `ConvexLipschitzOn.mem_F00`.

This refinement removes the bundled minimization-problem wrapper and restores the chapter's
source-facing fixed-parameter function class. Nonemptiness, closedness, and any chosen problem
packaging belong on downstream problem statements, not in Definition 3.64 itself. -/

/-- Definition 3.64: a function belongs to the source-facing class `𝓕_M^{0,0}(Q)`, written in
Lean as `𝓕⁰⁰[M](Q)`, when it is
convex on `Q` and `M`-Lipschitz on `Q`. -/
