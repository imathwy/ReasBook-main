/- Definition 7.59 lies in the Chapter 7 saddle-representation / maximization-value domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `maximalValueOn` in `Chap07/Definition_7_56`, the chapter maximization owner implemented through
  the canonical Chapter 1 minimization owner;
- `maximalValueOn_eq_sSup_image` in `Chap07/Definition_7_56`, the expansion theorem identifying
  that owner with the supremum of feasible objective values;
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.adjointObjective_eq_saddleFunction_of_isMinOn` in
  `Chap06/Text_6_1_2_Adjoint_Problem_Tractability_Caveat`, the nearby attained-inner-minimum
  bridge stated from canonical minimizer data rather than a bare infimum formula;
- `IsLeast.csInf_eq` in mathlib, the canonical bridge from an attained least value to the
  corresponding `sInf` identity.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `SaddlePointRepresentation P S`;
- core/canonical for the inner minimum: `IsLeast (Set.range (Ψ x)) (f x)`;
- core/canonical for the outer value: `maximalValueOn Set.univ f`;
- bridge/view: the derived `sInf` equality and the outer `sSup`-range expansion theorem.

Primitive data:
- the represented objective `f : P → ℝ`;
- the saddle function `Ψ : P → S → ℝ`;
- the pointwise least-value witness `IsLeast (Set.range (Ψ x)) (f x)`.

Derived API:
- the coercion to the represented objective;
- the derived equality `f x = sInf (Set.range (Ψ x))`;
- the chapter-canonical maximization value of that objective on `P`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `SaddlePointRepresentation`;
- core/canonical for the inner minimum: `IsLeast`;
- core/canonical for the outer value: `maximalValueOn`;
- bridge/view: `objective_eq` and `optimalValue_eq_sSup_range`.

The representation itself is source-facing and should stay explicit. The inner textbook minimum
must be stored as attained least-value data, not as a raw real `sInf`, while the outer value
should keep reusing the Chapter 7 owner `maximalValueOn` instead of restating a raw supremum.

/-- Definition 7.59: [Saddle-point representation] a concave maximization problem on a feasible
set `P` admits a saddle-point representation if it is given by an objective `f : P → ℝ` together
with a function `Ψ : P → S → ℝ` whose partial minimum over `S` recovers `f(x)` for every
`x ∈ P`. -/

  /-- The objective function `f : P → ℝ` of the maximization problem. -/
  objective : P → ℝ
  /-- The saddle function `Ψ : P → S → ℝ` whose minimum over `S` recovers the objective. -/
  saddleFunction : P → S → ℝ
  /-- For each feasible point `x ∈ P`, the objective value is a least element of the saddle slice
  `Ψ(x, ·)`. This is the faithful owner form of the textbook identity
  `f(x) = \min_{w ∈ S} Ψ(x, w)`. -/
