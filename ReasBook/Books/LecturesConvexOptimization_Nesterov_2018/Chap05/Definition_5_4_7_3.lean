/- Definition 5.4.7.3 lies in the Chapter 5 positive-orthant barrier / local-Hessian-norm domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `EuclideanSpace.positiveOrthant` and `EuclideanSpace.mem_positiveOrthant_iff` from
  `Chap01/Definition_1_10_2`, the intrinsic strict positive-orthant owner;
* `standardLogarithmicBarrierAmbient` from `Definition_5_4_3_2`, the chapter ambient bridge for
  the positive-orthant logarithmic barrier;
* `hessianLocalNorm` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for local Hessian norms;
* `sigmaThree` from `Definition_5_4_6_8`, the source-facing squared-local-norm bridge.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `scaledDirectionSigma x h`, the textbook scalar `σ`;
* core/canonical: the squared local norm `sigmaThree (standardLogarithmicBarrierAmbient 2) x h`;
* bridge/view: the explicit coordinate formula `σ = (h₁ / x₁)^2 + (h₂ / x₂)^2`.

Primitive data:
* a strictly positive base point `x : positiveOrthant 2`;
* a direction `h : ℝ²`.

Derived API:
* the specialized squared local norm `scaledDirectionSigma x h`;
* the owner-level identity with `‖h‖[standardLogarithmicBarrierAmbient 2; x]^2`;
* the coordinate expansion theorem below.

The earlier version exposed a totalized coordinate formula on all of `ℝ²`, which lost the strict
positivity semantics of the source barrier geometry. The refined file keeps the strict-domain base
point as primitive data and reuses the chapter owner `sigmaThree`, leaving the coordinate formula
as a companion bridge theorem. -/
