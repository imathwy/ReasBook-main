Lemma 5.4.5.1 lies in the chapter's Euclidean ellipsoid / affine-support domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `affineEllipsoid` and `mem_affineEllipsoid_iff` in `Chap03/Lemma_3_2_7`, the chapter owner and
  companion view for the textbook ellipsoid `E(H, v)`;
- `center_mem_affineEllipsoid` in the same file, showing that center-membership is derived from
  that owner rather than stored as separate data;
- `isGreatest_inner_image_spdEllipsoid` in `Chap03/Lemma_3_20`, the canonical centered-ellipsoid
  support-value theorem already stated on the same owner surface.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the affine half-space inequality on the chapter ellipsoid `E(H, v)`;
- core/canonical: `affineEllipsoid` together with the centered support maximum theorem
  `isGreatest_inner_image_spdEllipsoid`;
- bridge/view: translating `E(H, v)` to `E(H, 0)` and rewriting the affine inequality in terms of
  the support value.

Primitive data:
- the linear functional vector `a`;
- the center `v`;
- the affine bound `b`;
- the positive-definite shape matrix `H`.

Derived API:
- ellipsoid membership via `x ∈ E(H, v)`;
- the centered support bound over `E(H, 0)`;
- the quadratic inequality obtained by squaring that support bound under the nonnegative
  center-slack hypothesis `0 ≤ b - ⟪a, v⟫`.

The previous statement duplicated the owner ellipsoid through its raw quadratic predicate. This
refinement keeps the source-facing inequality theorem, but moves its public surface onto the
existing chapter owner and reuses the centered support theorem upstream instead of reproving the
same geometry locally.

-- Proof sketch: for the forward implication, evaluate the affine form at the boundary point
-- `v + (H *ᵥ a) / √⟪H a, a⟫`, which satisfies the boundary equation
-- `⟪H⁻¹ (x - v), x - v⟫ = 1`; for the reverse
-- implication, write `x = v + y` and apply Cauchy-Schwarz for the inner product induced by
-- `H⁻¹` to bound `⟪a, y⟫` by `√⟪H a, a⟫`.
/-- Lemma 5.4.5.1: for the ellipsoid
`W = {x | ⟪H⁻¹ (x - v), x - v⟫ ≤ 1}` cut out by a positive-definite matrix `H`, the affine
inequality `⟪a, x⟫ ≤ b` holds on all of `W` exactly when the quadratic bound
`⟪a, H a⟫ ≤ (b - ⟪a, v⟫)^2` holds. On the public surface, `W` is the chapter ellipsoid
owner `E(H, v)`. -/
