/- Lemma 5.1.1 is the affine-precomposition bridge for the Chapter 5 self-concordance data.

Primary domain:
- affine pullbacks in the Chapter 5 self-concordance / differential-calculus layer

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- `hessian`
- `hessianLocalNorm`
- `secondDirectionalDerivative_eq_hessian_quadratic_form`
- `thirdDirectionalDerivative`
- `ContinuousAffineMap`
- `IsSelfConcordantOnWith`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the Chapter 5.1 affine change-of-variables formulas
- core/canonical: the continuous affine pullback `g : E →ᴬ[ℝ] E₁` together with `hessian`,
  `thirdDirectionalDerivative`, and the Chapter 5 local-norm owner from `Definition_5_1_1`
- bridge/view: the textbook presentation `x ↦ A x + b`, recovered from
  `A.toContinuousAffineMap + ContinuousAffineMap.const ℝ E b`

Primitive data:
- the objective `f`
- the continuous affine map `g`
- the Hessian operator and third Fréchet derivative

Derived API:
- the linear part `g.contLinear`
- `‖u‖[f; x]`
- the self-concordance transfer theorem proved downstream in `Theorem_5_1_2`

This file therefore records only the affine-precomposition identities for the Chapter 5 owner
data, reusing the existing upstream owners instead of introducing another parallel wrapper API.
The previous `(A, b)` surface was too low-level for the Fréchet-calculus owners `hessian` and
`hessianLocalNorm`, because those identities are naturally statements about continuous affine
pullbacks. The textbook `A x + b` presentation is a thin view of this owner abstraction rather
than the primitive public data. -/
