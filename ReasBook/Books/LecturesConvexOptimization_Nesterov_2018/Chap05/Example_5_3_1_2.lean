/- Example 5.3.1.2 lies in the Chapter 5 self-concordant-barrier / quadratic-objective domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
* `quadraticAffineObjective` together with `quadraticAffineObjective_hessian_eq` in
  `Example_5_1_2`, the source-facing owner and its canonical Hessian API for affine-quadratic
  objectives;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` in `Definition_5_3_2`, the chapter owner for `ν`-self-
  concordant barriers;
* `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn` in `Definition_5_0_23`, the chapter owner for positive-definite
  Hessians on a domain;
* `selfAdjointPart` in mathlib, the canonical projection from an operator to its self-adjoint
  part.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the affine-quadratic objective `quadraticAffineObjective α a A`;
* core/canonical: `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` and `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn`;
* bridge/view: passage from `A` to the canonical mathlib owner `selfAdjointPart ℝ A`, which
  preserves both the quadratic-affine objective and the quadratic form `u ↦ ⟪u, A u⟫`.

Primitive data:
* the scalar offset `α`;
* the linear coefficient `a`;
* the bounded operator `A`;
* strict positivity of the quadratic form `u ↦ ⟪u, A u⟫` on nonzero directions.

Derived API:
* the self-adjoint part `selfAdjointPart ℝ A`, which is the actual Hessian owner of the quadratic
  objective;
* positive definiteness of the Hessian of `quadraticAffineObjective α a A` on `Set.univ`;
* the barrier contradiction obtained from the owner inequality on `Set.univ`.

This refinement keeps the example source-facing, but removes the redundant self-adjointness binder
from the main theorems and reuses the existing Chapter 5 Hessian-positivity owner after passing to
the canonical self-adjoint part of the quadratic operator. -/

-- Proof sketch: if the quadratic objective were a `ν`-self-concordant barrier on all of `E`,
-- then the barrier-parameter inequality would hold for every base point and every direction.
-- Passing first to the self-adjoint part `S := selfAdjointPart ℝ A` does not change the quadratic
-- objective, and `quadraticAffineObjective_hasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn` upgrades the strict
-- positivity of `u ↦ ⟪u, A u⟫` to the Chapter 5 positive-definite-Hessian owner. Along the ray
-- `x = t • u` with `u ≠ 0`, the left-hand side then becomes a quadratic polynomial in `t` with
-- positive leading coefficient `2 * ⟪S u, u⟫ = 2 * ⟪A u, u⟫`, so it is unbounded above as
-- `t → ∞`, contradicting the uniform bound by `ν`.
/-- Example 5.3.1.2: if the quadratic form `u ↦ ⟪u, A u⟫` is strictly positive on nonzero
directions, then the quadratic function `x ↦ α + ⟪a, x⟫ + (1 / 2) ⟪A x, x⟫` on all of `E` is not
a `ν`-self-concordant barrier. -/
