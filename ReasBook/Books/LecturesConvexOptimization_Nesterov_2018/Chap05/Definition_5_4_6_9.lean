/- Definition 5.4.6.9 is a recall-only item in the subsection's directional differential-calculus
domain for the composed barrier `Ψ = coneCompositionBarrier F Φ ξ β`.

Sampled owner declarations:
* mathlib `lineDeriv`, the canonical first directional-derivative owner;
* `secondDirectionalDerivative` from `Definition_5_0_10`, the chapter owner for repeated second
  directional derivatives of real-valued functions;
* `thirdDirectionalDerivative` from `Definition_5_0_10`, the corresponding third-order owner;
* `coneCompositionBarrier` from `Definition_5_4_6_5`, the source-facing barrier whose
  directional derivatives are being recalled here.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the textbook quantities `D₁`, `D₂`, and `D₃` attached to `Ψ`;
* core/canonical: `lineDeriv`, `secondDirectionalDerivative`, and `thirdDirectionalDerivative`
  applied to `coneCompositionBarrier F Φ ξ β`;
* bridge/view: none beyond this direct specialization.

Primitive data:
* the barrier `F`, outer term `Φ`, map `ξ`, and parameter `β`;
* the base point `(x, z)` and direction `(h, v)`.

Derived API:
* the three canonical owner expressions for the first, second, and third directional derivatives
  of `coneCompositionBarrier F Φ ξ β`.

Definition 5.4.6.9 introduces no new owner beyond those established derivative operators, so the
file recalls the canonical applications directly instead of keeping exact-interface wrapper aliases
with `rfl` companion lemmas. -/
