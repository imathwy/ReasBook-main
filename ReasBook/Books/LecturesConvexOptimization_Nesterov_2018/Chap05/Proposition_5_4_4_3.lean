-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Proposition 5.4.4.3 is a bridge/view item in the chapter's semidefinite Newton-step
arithmetic-cost domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in the same domain:
* `IsSemidefiniteNewtonDirectionOutput` in `Alg_5_4_4_1`, the Chapter 5 source-facing owner for
  one execution of the Newton-step subroutine;
* `semidefiniteNewtonNormalMatrix` in `Alg_5_4_4_1`, the owner for the dense multiplier system
  `S λ = d`;
* `semidefiniteNewtonDirectionFromMultiplier` in `Alg_5_4_4_1`, the owner for the recovered
  Newton direction `Δ = X (-U + ∑ λ_j A_j) X`;
* `GeneralIterativeScheme.totalArithmeticWork` in `Chap01/Definition_1_2_12`, the broader
  project owner for accumulated arithmetic work across iterations.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the Chapter 5 Newton-step owner `IsSemidefiniteNewtonDirectionOutput`;
* core/canonical: `ℕ`-valued arithmetic-cost expressions and polynomial inequalities on `(n, m)`;
* bridge/view: the dimension-only dense arithmetic-work model for one execution of that owner.

Primitive data:
* `n`, `m : ℕ`.

Derived API:
* the concrete dense-work expression `semidefiniteNewtonStepDenseArithmeticWorkBound n m`;
* its definitional expansion;
* the regime-specific bound by `n^2 * (m + n) * m`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `IsSemidefiniteNewtonDirectionOutput`;
* core/canonical: arithmetic work as an `ℕ`-valued expression on primitive dimensions;
* bridge/view: this file's dense one-step arithmetic-cost estimate.

This refinement keeps the source-facing Newton-step owner upstream in `Alg_5_4_4_1` and leaves
this file responsible only for the dimension-level dense arithmetic model and its asymptotic
bound. -/

#check IsSemidefiniteNewtonDirectionOutput

/-- A parameter-only dense arithmetic upper bound for one execution of the Newton-step subroutine
that computes the matrices `B_j = X * A_j * X`, assembles the dense linear system `S λ = d`,
solves that system, and forms `Δ = X * (-U + ∑ λ_j A_j) * X` using standard dense routines. -/
def semidefiniteNewtonStepDenseArithmeticWorkBound (n m : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  2 * m * n ^ 3 + m ^ 2 * n ^ 2 + m ^ 3 + (m + 1) * n ^ 2 + 2 * n ^ 3

-- Proof sketch: unfold `semidefiniteNewtonStepDenseArithmeticWorkBound`; the right-hand side is
-- exactly the sum of the dense-operation counts assigned to the four steps of the subroutine.
/-- Expanding `semidefiniteNewtonStepDenseArithmeticWorkBound` recovers the stepwise dense
operation count used for the Newton-step subroutine. -/
theorem semidefiniteNewtonStepDenseArithmeticWorkBound_eq (n m : ℕ) :
    semidefiniteNewtonStepDenseArithmeticWorkBound n m =
      2 * m * n ^ 3 + m ^ 2 * n ^ 2 + m ^ 3 + (m + 1) * n ^ 2 + 2 * n ^ 3 :=
  rfl

-- Proof sketch: bound the Step 1 and Step 4 matrix-multiplication terms by multiples of
-- `n^3 * m`, bound the assembly and solve terms by multiples of `n^2 * m^2`, use
-- `m ≤ n (n + 1) / 2` to absorb the `m^3` term into `n^2 * m^2`, and then factor the result as a
-- constant multiple of `n^2 * (m + n) * m`.
/-- Proposition 5.4.4.3: if `1 ≤ m ≤ n(n + 1) / 2`, then one dense execution of the Newton-step
subroutine has arithmetic work bounded by a constant multiple of `n^2 * (m + n) * m`, and hence
has arithmetic complexity `O(n^2 * (m + n) * m)`. -/
