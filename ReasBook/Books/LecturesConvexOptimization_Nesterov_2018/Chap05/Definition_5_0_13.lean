noncomputable section

universe u

/- Definition 5.0.13 lies in the Hessian-local-norm / Dikin-ellipsoid domain.

 Sampled owner declarations:
* `hessianLocalNorm` in `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for the Hessian-induced local norm;
* the notation `‖u‖[f; x]`, the source-facing surface for that owner;
* `hessianLocalNorm_def`, the bridge back to the square-root Hessian quadratic form;
* the notational-owner precedent `W(G, v)` in `Definition_5_4_5_6`, showing that source-facing
  ellipsoid owners in this project should expose textbook notation on the theorem surface.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `openDikinEllipsoid f x r` and `dikinEllipsoid f x r`;
* core/canonical: `‖y - x‖[f; x]` for the local-norm quantity;
* bridge/view: the membership lemmas and `hessianLocalNorm_def`.

Primitive data:
* a function `f`;
* a center `x`;
* a radius `r`.

 Derived API:
* the open-ball owner `openDikinEllipsoid`;
* the closed-ball owner `dikinEllipsoid`;
* the textbook notations `W⁰[f; x](r)` and `W[f; x](r)`;
* membership lemmas stated first in local-norm form, then as raw square-root expansions, and
  finally in quadratic-form form under the Hessian-positivity regime.

This file owns the Dikin-ellipsoid layer directly rather than recalling it from a downstream
theorem file. -/
