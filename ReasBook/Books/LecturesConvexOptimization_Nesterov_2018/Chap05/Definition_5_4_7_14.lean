open EuclideanSpace (positiveOrthant)

variable {n : ℕ}

local notation "Eₙ" => EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)
local notation "Xₙ" => positiveOrthant n

/- Definition 5.4.7.14 lies in the Chapter 5 positive-orthant / coordinatewise-scaling domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `EuclideanSpace.positiveOrthant` from `Chap01/Definition_1_10_2`, the chapter owner for the
  strict positive orthant;
* `EuclideanSpace.mem_positiveOrthant_iff` from `Chap01/Definition_1_10_2`, the coordinatewise
  membership bridge for that owner;
* `WithLp.toLp` from mathlib, the canonical constructor from coordinate families into
  `EuclideanSpace`;
* `EuclideanSpace` as the ambient `PiLp 2` owner, whose coordinates are already accessed
  pointwise.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `relativeDirection x h`, the textbook relative direction `δ_x(h)`;
* core/canonical: the strict-orthant owner `positiveOrthant n` together with the canonical
  ambient `EuclideanSpace` constructor `WithLp.toLp`;
* bridge/view: the coordinate formula `δ[x](h) i = h i / x i`.

Primitive data:
* a base point `x : positiveOrthant n`;
* a direction `h : ℝⁿ`.

Derived API:
* the owner definition `relativeDirection`;
* the scoped notation `δ[x](h)` for the textbook relative direction `δ_x(h)`;
* the coordinate projection lemma `relativeDirection_apply`.

The previous version routed the source-facing owner through ad hoc local `Div` and `CoeFun`
instances. This refinement keeps the same mathematical object, but defines it directly by its
canonical coordinate formula in `EuclideanSpace`; the public bridge API is therefore the textbook
coordinate identity itself, with no hidden instance scaffolding. -/

/-- Definition 5.4.7.14: for a strictly positive point `x ∈ ℝ^n_{++}` and a direction `h ∈ ℝⁿ`,
the relative direction `δ_x(h)` is the vector whose `i`-th coordinate is `h^(i) / x^(i)`. -/

-- Proof sketch: `relativeDirection` is defined by the coordinate formula
-- `WithLp.toLp 2 (fun i ↦ h i / x i)`, so evaluation at `i` is definitional.
/-- Evaluating `δ[x](h)` at `i` recovers the coordinate quotient `h^(i) / x^(i)`. -/
