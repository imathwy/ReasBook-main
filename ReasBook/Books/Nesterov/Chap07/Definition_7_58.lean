/- Definition 7.58 lies in the chapter's barrier-subgradient / dual-seminorm domain on real
inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Seminorm.IsNorm` in `Chap02/Definition_2_5`
- `Seminorm.dualNorm` in `Chap02/Definition_2_5`
- `Seminorm.dualNorm_apply` in `Chap02/Definition_2_5`
- `constrainedSubdifferential` and `∂[Q] f(x)` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_5`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: Definition 7.58's barrier subgradient class together with the sequences `λₖ`
  and `βₖ`
- core/canonical: `Seminorm.dualNorm` and `constrainedSubdifferential`
- bridge/view: the coercion `fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ)` into the Chapter 3 owner surface

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `P` and distinguished subset `P₀`
- the point-indexed norm family `pointNorm : P₀ → Seminorm ℝ E`
- the separation proofs `hpointNorm : ∀ x, Seminorm.IsNorm (pointNorm x)`

Derived API:
- the membership expansion of the barrier subgradient class

The previous file duplicated the chapter owners `Seminorm.IsNorm`, `Seminorm.dualNorm`, and
`constrainedSubdifferential`. This refinement keeps the source-facing barrier notion but moves its
primitive convex-analysis data to those canonical owners, and it quantifies directly over `x : P₀`
rather than over ambient points plus a separate membership proof. The dual `‖·‖ₓ*`-bound uses
the canonical owner `(pointNorm x).dualNorm` directly instead of a parallel local bridge. -/

/-- Definition 7.58: for a feasible set `P ⊆ E`, a distinguished subset `P₀`, and a norm `‖·‖ₓ`
on `E` for each `x ∈ P₀`, `barrierSubgradientClass P P₀ pointNorm hpointNorm M` is the set
`𝓑_M(P)` of real-valued functions on `E` whose constrained subdifferential over `P` is
nonempty at every `x ∈ P₀` with some subgradient having `‖·‖ₓ*`-norm at most `M`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `barrierSubgradientClass`; membership is exactly the pointwise bounded
-- constrained-subgradient condition over the distinguished subset `P₀`.
/-- Membership in `barrierSubgradientClass P P₀ pointNorm hpointNorm M` means that each
`x ∈ P₀` admits a constrained subgradient over `P` whose dual `‖·‖ₓ*`-norm is at most `M`; the
feasibility condition `x ∈ P` is already part of the constrained-subdifferential owner. -/
