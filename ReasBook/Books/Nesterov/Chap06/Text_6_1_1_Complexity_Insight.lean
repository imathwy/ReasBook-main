noncomputable section

/- Text 6.1.1-Complexity Insight lies in the chapter's scalar oracle-complexity scaling domain.

Owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `sqrt_rate_complexity_bound` in `Chap01/Definition_1_2_5`, the earlier project owner for turning
  a square-root rate estimate into an explicit complexity threshold;
* `constantStepSchemeIII_objective_gap_le_geometric_rate` in `Chap02/Theorem_2_46`, the chapter
  accelerated-gradient owner carrying the canonical square-root rate factor on the method side;
* mathlib `Real.sqrt_le_sqrt` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`, the canonical scalar-order tools
  governing the proof of the present rescaling lemma.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the displayed `ε⁻¹` oracle bound for the smoothed surrogate complexity estimate;
* core/canonical: the scalar comparison
  `L_μ / ε ≤ (C_L / c_μ) / ε^2` together with monotonicity of `Real.sqrt`;
* bridge/view: this theorem, which isolates the scalar oracle-count algebra from the surrounding
  smoothing and optimization statements.

Primitive data:
* the positive scale parameters `ε` and `cμ`;
* the fast-gradient prefactor `CF`;
* the smoothing-scale inequality `cμ * ε ≤ μ`;
* the Lipschitz-growth bound `Lμ ≤ CL / μ`;
* the input oracle-count estimate `(N : ℝ) ≤ CF * sqrt (Lμ / ε)`.

Derived API:
* the explicit inverse-`ε` oracle-count bound
  `(N : ℝ) ≤ (CF * Real.sqrt (CL / cμ)) / ε`.

This file is therefore kept at the scalar bridge layer. The nearby bundled Chapter 6 smoothing
theorem should reuse this atomic lemma for its oracle-count conclusion instead of carrying a
parallel local copy of the same algebra.

/-- Text 6.1.1-Complexity Insight: if the smoothed surrogate has gradient Lipschitz constant
`L_μ` with `L_μ ≤ C_L / μ`, the smoothing parameter is chosen on the scale `μ ≳ ε`, and a fast
gradient method reaches an `ε`-approximation within `C_F * √(L_μ / ε)` oracle calls, then the
number of oracle calls is bounded by a constant multiple of `ε⁻¹`. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `Lμ / ε ≤ 0`, then the oracle estimate forces `N = 0`, so the conclusion is
-- immediate. Otherwise `Lμ ≥ 0`; the lower bound `cμ * ε ≤ μ` and positivity of `ε` imply
-- `μ > 0`, hence `L_μ / ε ≤ (C_L / c_μ) / ε^2`. Taking square roots and multiplying by the
-- fast-gradient prefactor `C_F` gives the displayed `1 / ε` oracle-complexity bound.
