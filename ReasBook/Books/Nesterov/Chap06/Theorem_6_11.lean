/- Theorem 6.11 lies in the Chapter 6 constrained-minimization / primal-oracle domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner for a
  feasible set together with a real-valued objective;
- `constrainedArgmin` with notation `argmin[Q]` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in
  `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner for minimizer sets;
- `explicitModelSmoothedProblem` in `Chap06/Definition_6_9`, the Chapter 6 pattern of keeping the
  objective/problem as the source-facing owner and deriving minimizers canonically;
- `AffineVariationalInequalityProblem.gapProblem` in `Chap06/Definition_6_18`, the nearby Chapter
  6 owner pattern using `Set.univ` on a feasible subtype.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `linearOptimizationOracleObjective`;
- core/canonical: `argmin[Set.univ] (linearOptimizationOracleObjective s Ψ)`;
- bridge/view: the pointwise evaluation formula and the translation from `IsMinOn` attainment to
  argmin membership.

Primitive data:
- a feasible set `Q : Set E`;
- a linear functional `s : StrongDual ℝ E`;
- a regularizer `Ψ : Q → ℝ`.

Derived API:
- the affine-plus-regularizer objective on the feasible subtype `Q`;
- its canonical minimizer set `argmin[Set.univ] (linearOptimizationOracleObjective s Ψ)`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `linearOptimizationOracleObjective`;
- core/canonical: `argmin[Set.univ]`;
- bridge/view: `linearOptimizationOracleObjective_apply` and
  `exists_linear_optimization_oracle_point`.

The previous theorem encoded existence of an optimal point through equality with
`sInf (Set.range ...)`. In this project domain, minimizers are canonically owned by `argmin`,
so the main existence theorem now lands in that owner instead of keeping a parallel value-level
existence surface.

`min_{x ∈ Q} {⟨s, x⟩ + Ψ(x)}`
