/- Proposition 6.41 lies in the chapter's constrained-subdifferential / affine-optimality domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `constrainedSubdifferential` together with the notation `∂[Q] f(x)` in
  `Chap03/Definition_3_1_5`;
- `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_5`, the atomic bridge from the
  owner to the raw affine lower-support inequality;
- `ConvexOn.isMinOn_add_iff_neg_hasGradient_mem_constrainedSubdifferential` in
  `Chap03/Theorem_3_1_23`, a downstream owner-level consumer of the same constrained
  subdifferential;
- `subdifferentialWithin` in `Chap03/Theorem_3_44`, the real-valued bridge/view built on the same
  owner.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: Proposition 6.41's affine optimality criterion for an extended-valued constrained
  subgradient;
- core/canonical: `constrainedSubdifferential`;
- bridge/view: `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`.

Primitive data:
- a feasible set `Q`, extended-valued objective `Ψ`, and feasible base point `v ∈ Q`;
- finiteness of the base value `Ψ v < ⊤`;
- the affine optimality inequality on `Q`.

Derived API:
- the owner-level conclusion `-s ∈ ∂[Q] Ψ(v)`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the proposition below, written directly on the chapter owner notation `∂[Q] Ψ(v)`;
- core/canonical: `constrainedSubdifferential`;
- bridge/view: the raw affine inequality hypothesis and the membership lemma
  `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`.

The previous file duplicated the Chapter 3 owner locally and omitted the owner feasibility
condition `v ∈ Q`. This refinement removes the duplicate wheel, states the proposition directly
with the canonical owner surface, and keeps only the textbook affine inequality as the bridge
assumption.

/-- Proposition 6.41: if a feasible point `v ∈ Q` satisfies the affine optimality inequality
`⟪s, x - v⟫ + Ψ(x) ≥ Ψ(v)` for every `x ∈ Q`, then `-s` belongs to the constrained
subdifferential of `Ψ` at `v` relative to `Q`. -/
-- Proof sketch: unfold the owner membership criterion
-- `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff`. The finiteness hypothesis gives `v ∈ dom Ψ`, and the
-- assumed inequality rearranges to the defining affine lower-support inequality for `-s`.
