-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Theorem 3.19 is a recall-only surface in the chapter's extended-valued convex-subdifferential
domain.

Primary domain:
- convex analysis of `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions on Euclidean space.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `dom` and `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter owners for the effective domain
  and finite-value representative;
- `IsSubgradientAt` and `subdifferential` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the chapter owners for
  extended-valued subgradients;
- `subdifferential_nonempty_and_isBounded_of_convexOn_effectiveDomain_of_mem_interior` in
  `Theorem_3_1_15`, the canonical chapter theorem on that owner surface.

Best owner abstraction:
- `subdifferential_nonempty_and_isBounded_of_convexOn_effectiveDomain_of_mem_interior`.

Primitive data:
- none in this file; the theorem already lives upstream on the canonical chapter owners.

Derived API:
- this recall-only source-facing entry point.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Theorem 3.19's nonempty-and-bounded subdifferential statement;
- core/canonical: the upstream theorem in `Theorem_3_1_15` on `dom`, `withTopRealPart`, and
  `subdifferential`;
- bridge/view: this recall surface.

The previous file rebuilt local copies of the effective domain, subgradient predicate, and
subdifferential set even though those notions are already owned upstream, and it duplicated the
same theorem already present in `Theorem_3_1_15`. This refinement removes that parallel local API
and reuses the canonical chapter theorem directly.
