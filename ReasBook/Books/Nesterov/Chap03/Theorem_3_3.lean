Theorem 3.3 lies in the chapter's `WithTop`-valued convex-analysis / effective-epigraph domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph`,
  `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph_eq_epigraph_withTopRealPart`,
  `dom`, and `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter owner surface and bridge from an
  `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function to its finite real part and effective epigraph;
- mathlib `convexOn_iff_convex_epigraph`, the core owner equivalence between `ConvexOn` and
  convexity of the ordinary epigraph.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the effective-epigraph convexity criterion below on
  `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph f`;
- core/canonical: `ConvexOn ℝ (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)`;
- bridge/view: `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph f`.

Primitive data:
- the chapter owner `dom f`;
- the chapter owner `withTopRealPart f`.

Derived API:
- `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph f`;
- `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph_eq_epigraph_withTopRealPart`;
- the equivalence below, obtained by reusing `convexOn_iff_convex_epigraph`.

The previous statement duplicated the owner effective-domain set `{x | f x < ⊤}` and the finite
real-part map `x ↦ (f x).untopD 0`. These are already owned upstream by `dom f` and
`withTopRealPart f`. The remaining noncanonical surface was the raw composite
`constrainedEpigraph (dom f) f`, so this file now uses the dedicated owner
`WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph f` and its upstream bridge to the ordinary epigraph of
`withTopRealPart f`.

/-- Theorem 3.3: an `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function is convex on its effective domain exactly when its
epigraph over that domain is a convex subset of the ambient product space. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply mathlib's `convexOn_iff_convex_epigraph` to the owner finite real part
-- `withTopRealPart f` on the owner effective domain `dom f`, then rewrite the resulting ordinary
-- epigraph using `WithTopConvexAnalysis.effectiveEpigraph_eq_epigraph_withTopRealPart`.
