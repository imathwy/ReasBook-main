/- Lemma 3.1.2 is a source-facing recall in the chapter's `WithTop`-valued convex-analysis
domain.

Primary domain:
- restriction of a closed convex extended-real-valued function to a closed convex subset.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- `ClosedConvexOn` from `Definition_3_1_1_5`
- `ClosedConvexOn.restrict` from `Definition_3_1_1_5`
- `ClosedConvexOn.subset_withTopEffectiveDomain`
- `ClosedConvexOn.isClosed_constrainedEpigraph`
- `ClosedConvexOn.convex_constrainedEpigraph`

Best owner abstraction:
- `ClosedConvexOn`

Primitive data:
- the owner witness `hf : ClosedConvexOn Q f`
- the subset, closedness, and convexity data for `Q₁ ⊆ Q`

Derived API:
- the canonical owner theorem `ClosedConvexOn.restrict`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `ClosedConvexOn.restrict`
- core/canonical: `ClosedConvexOn`
- bridge/view: `constrainedEpigraph`, together with the closed/convex cylinder intersection proof
  internalized in the owner theorem

This file is recall-only: the owner theorem now lives where `ClosedConvexOn` itself is defined,
so the later chapter item reuses that exact owner theorem instead of introducing a duplicate
specialized copy.
