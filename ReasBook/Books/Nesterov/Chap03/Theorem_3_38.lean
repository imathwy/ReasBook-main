/- Theorem 3.38 lies in the chapter's max-type active-subgradient saddle domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `pointwiseSupremumOn` in `Chap03/Theorem_3_1_8` and
  `activePointwiseSupremumOnIndices` in `Chap03/Lemma_3_1_14`, the chapter owners for the
  faithful upper envelope and active parameters;
- `subdifferentialWithin` and the source-facing notation `∂[P] f(x)` in `Chap03/Theorem_3_44`,
  the chapter owner surface for relative subgradients;
- `IsSaddlePointOn` in `Mathlib/Order/SaddlePoint`, the canonical saddle-point owner on
  `P × S`;
- `minimax_eq_of_activeSubgradientRepresentation_at_minimizer` in `Chap03/Theorem_3_1_31`, the
  stronger barycentric minimax theorem from which the present source-facing result is a more
  general abstract-parameter variant.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: existence of a saddle parameter produced from an active-subgradient
  representation;
- core/canonical: `pointwiseSupremumOn`, `activePointwiseSupremumOnIndices`, `∂[P] f(x)`,
  together with `IsSaddlePointOn`;
- bridge/view: the raw aggregation hypothesis
  `∃ uBar ∈ S, ∀ x ∈ P, ∑ i, λ i * Ψ x (u i) ≤ Ψ x uBar`, which keeps the source's abstract
  parameter `uBar : U` instead of imposing additive structure on `U`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible primal set `P` and parameter set `S`;
- the kernel `Ψ`;
- the minimizing primal point `xStar` and its active-slice subgradient representation.

Derived API:
- the real-valued objective `f` together with its faithful upper-envelope bridge on `P`;
- the owner active set `activePointwiseSupremumOnIndices S (fun x u ↦ (Ψ x u : WithTop ℝ)) xStar`;
- the canonical saddle predicate `IsSaddlePointOn P S Ψ xStar`.

The previous version duplicated the subgradient owner locally and treated the real-valued upper
envelope as a primitive owner. This refinement deletes the duplicate wheel, reuses the faithful
`WithTop ℝ` upper-envelope owner through an explicit real-valued bridge `f`, removes the one-off
saddle and aggregation wrappers, and phrases the source-facing result directly on the chapter
owner API. The active-family surface also lives at the canonical finite-index layer
`ι : Type*` with `[Fintype ι]`, not the over-concrete display model `Fin k`. -/

/-- Theorem 3.38: if `f : E → ℝ` is a real-valued objective on `P` whose `WithTop ℝ` lift agrees
with the faithful upper-envelope owner
`pointwiseSupremumOn S (fun x u ↦ (Ψ x u : WithTop ℝ))`, if `xStar` minimizes `f` on `P`, if a
relative subgradient `gStar ∈ ∂[P] f(xStar)` annihilates every feasible
displacement `x - xStar`, and if `gStar` is a simplex-weighted combination of relative
subgradients `g i ∈ ∂[P] (fun x ↦ Ψ x (u i)) (xStar)` of active slices
`x ↦ Ψ(x, u i)` at `xStar` whose weighted slice values can be
aggregated by one parameter `uBar ∈ S`, then that aggregated parameter is a saddle point of `Ψ`
on `P × S` with first coordinate `xStar`; equivalently, it realizes the same lower-envelope value
as the primal optimum at `xStar`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the representation
-- `gStar = ∑ i, weights.weights i • g i` and the orthogonality assumption to rewrite
-- `f xStar` as a weighted sum of the pairings `⟪g i, x - xStar⟫`. Apply the
-- relative subgradient inequality for each active slice `Ψ(·, u i)` and use activity at `xStar`
-- to get `f xStar ≤ ∑ i, weights.weights i * Ψ x (u i)` for every `x ∈ P`.
-- The aggregation hypothesis upgrades this to `f xStar ≤ Ψ x uBar` on `P`,
-- so `f xStar` is a lower bound for the image of `x ↦ Ψ x uBar` on `P`. The
-- faithful upper-envelope bridge gives `Ψ xStar uBar ≤ f xStar`, and for
-- every `u ∈ S` we also have `Ψ xStar u ≤ f xStar`. Combining these two
-- bounds yields `Ψ xStar u ≤ Ψ x uBar` for all `x ∈ P` and `u ∈ S`, i.e. the canonical saddle
-- relation `IsSaddlePointOn P S Ψ xStar uBar`.
