Definition 3.30 is a recall-only item in the chapter's sampled affine-model aggregation domain.

Primary domain:
- convex optimization models obtained by averaging sampled affine minorants.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `StdSimplex.Strict` in `Nesterov.Chap03.Definition_3_4`, the earlier chapter owner for
  the textbook's strict-positivity side condition on simplex coefficients
- `sampledAffineMinorant` in `Nesterov.Chap03.Proposition_3_26`, the chapter owner for one
  sampled affine oracle model
- the mathlib affine-map sum
  `∑ i, α i • sampledAffineMinorant (y i) (g i) (f (y i)) : E →ᵃ[ℝ] ℝ`,
  the canonical owner for the aggregated model
- `sum_smul_sampledAffineMinorant_apply` in `Nesterov.Chap03.Proposition_3_26`, the evaluation
  bridge for that canonical affine-map sum

Best owner abstraction:
- `source-facing`: the textbook aggregated linear model built from sampled points
  `y₀, …, y_N`, weights, and the sampled slopes `g (y k)`
- `core/canonical`: the affine-map sum
  `∑ i, α i • sampledAffineMinorant (y i) (g i) (f (y i))`
- `bridge/view`: the simplex specialization `α = weights.weights` together with the sampled slope
  family `g ∘ y`; `StdSimplex.Strict` records the source's redundant strict-positivity side
  condition when needed, while the later affine-map owner in
  `Nesterov.Chap03.Proposition_3_27` is the corresponding packaged affine view of the same
  finite averaging construction

Primitive data:
- `weights : StdSimplex ℝ (Fin (N + 1))`
- `y : Fin (N + 1) → E`
- `f : E → ℝ`
- `g : E → E`

Derived API:
- the owner specialization
  `∑ i, weights.weights i • sampledAffineMinorant (y i) (g (y i)) (f (y i))`
- the pointwise sum formula obtained by unfolding that owner definition

Source/core/bridge triage:
- `source-facing`: the sampled aggregated linear model itself
- `core/canonical`: the affine-map sum above
- `bridge/view`: evaluation of the simplex specialization by
  `sum_smul_sampledAffineMinorant_apply`

Definition 3.30 adds no new mathematical data beyond this owner specialization, so this file
checks the canonical owner expression directly and introduces no parallel public alias such as
`aggregatedLinearModel`.

/- Definition 3.30: the aggregated linear model attached to sample points `y₀, …, y_N` and a
normalized coefficient vector is the direct simplex specialization of the canonical affine-map
sum of the sampled affine minorants. The textbook additionally assumes these weights are strictly
positive, but the defining expression depends only on the normalized simplex data. -/

/- Evaluating the canonical affine-map sum for Definition 3.30 recovers the weighted sum of the
sampled affine oracle models. -/
