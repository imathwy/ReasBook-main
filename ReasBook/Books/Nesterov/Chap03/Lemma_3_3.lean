/-- Lemma 3.3: in a real inner-product space, the support function of the convex hull of
`Q₁ ∪ Q₂` is the pointwise maximum of the support functions of `Q₁` and `Q₂`. The textbook
`ℝⁿ` statement is the specialization `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: rewrite away the convex hull by `supportFunction_convexHull_eq`, then expand the
-- support function of the union with `supportFunction_apply` and `sSup_union`.
