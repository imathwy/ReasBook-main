Definition 5.2.8 lies in the strongly convex smooth minimization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `StrongConvexOn` from mathlib, the canonical owner for whole-space strong convexity;
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian` from `Chap04/Definition_4_2_7`, written on theorem surfaces as
  `f ∈ C22[L₃]`, the project owner for global Hessian-Lipschitz regularity;
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian.sndFDeriv_norm_sub_le`, the canonical second-derivative estimate
  on normed spaces;
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian.norm_sub_le`, the Hilbert-space Hessian estimate derived from
  that owner;
* `IsStrongConvexSmoothObjective` with source-facing notation `f ∈ 𝓢[μ, L]¹¹` from
  `Chap02/Definition_2_17`, the chapter owner pattern for bundled optimization classes.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the bundled strongly convex `C³` Hessian-Lipschitz regime
  `f ∈ 𝓢[σ₂, L₃]²²`;
* core/canonical: `StrongConvexOn Set.univ σ₂ f` and `f ∈ C22[L₃]`;
* bridge/view: the companion projection to `f ∈ C22[L₃]` and the textbook Hessian-difference
  inequality.

Primitive data:
* the strong-convexity parameter `σ₂`;
* the Hessian-Lipschitz constant `L₃`;
* positivity of `σ₂`;
* whole-space strong convexity of `f`;
* the canonical smoothness owner `f ∈ C22[L₃]`;
* the extra `C³` regularity needed by the source regime.

Derived API:
* the inherited `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian L₃ f` instance;
* the source-facing theorem `objective_mem : f ∈ C22[L₃]`;
* on real Hilbert spaces, the textbook estimate `‖hessian f x - hessian f y‖ ≤ L₃ ‖x - y‖`.

This file keeps the source-facing bundled regime, but now places its primitive owner data on the
same normed-space layer as `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian`. It no longer stores a duplicate raw
field `LipschitzWith L₃ (fun x ↦ fderiv ℝ (∇ f) x)`: that data is owned upstream by
`HasLipschitzContinuousHessian`. The Hilbert-specific textbook Hessian estimate remains a derived
bridge theorem. Positivity, whole-space strong convexity, and `C³` regularity stay available
through the class projections rather than a global bundled `Fact` instance. -/

/-- Definition 5.2.8: a real-valued objective on a real normed space is in the
strongly convex `C³` minimization regime with parameters `σ₂` and `L₃` when `σ₂ > 0`, the
objective is `σ₂`-strongly convex on all of `E`, it belongs to the chapter smoothness class
`C22[L₃]`, and it is three-times continuously differentiable. -/
