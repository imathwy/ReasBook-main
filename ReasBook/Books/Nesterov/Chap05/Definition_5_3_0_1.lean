/- Definition 5.3.0.1 is a recall-only item in the chapter's self-concordance domain.

Primary domain:
- self-concordant functions on an open convex domain in a real inner-product space.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `IsSelfConcordantOnWith` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the quantitative owner carrying the constant
  `M_f`;
- `IsSelfConcordantOn` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the existential source-facing relaxation;
- `IsStandardSelfConcordantOn` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the canonical owner for the case
  `M_f = 1`;
- the definitional equality
  `IsStandardSelfConcordantOn dom f = IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom 1 f`.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: standard self-concordance on `dom`;
- core/canonical: `IsStandardSelfConcordantOn dom f`;
- bridge/view: the definitional equality with `IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom 1 f`.

Primitive data:
- none; this item only recalls an existing owner.

Derived API:
- the owner predicate `IsStandardSelfConcordantOn`;
- the definitional equality with `IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom 1 f`.

This file therefore keeps no parallel local predicate for “self-concordant with constant `1`”.
It recalls the upstream owner from `Definition_5_1_1` directly, and the textbook specification is
checked by definitional equality instead of a redundant wrapper theorem. -/
