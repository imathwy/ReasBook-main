variable (n : ℕ)

/- Definition 5.4.7.16 lies in the finite-dimensional simplex / coordinate-vector domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* mathlib `stdSimplex`, the canonical owner of the standard simplex;
* mathlib `stdSimplex_eq_inter`, the companion decomposition of the same owner into
  nonnegativity and normalization constraints;
* mathlib `Pi.one_apply`, the canonical coordinate formula for the constant-one function;
* `Definition_6_11`, a later project recall of the same simplex owner, reusing the same shared
  notation surface.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the textbook simplex `Δ_n`, exposed in Lean by the reusable notation `Δ[n]`, and
  the all-ones vector `\bar e_n` in `ℝⁿ`;
* core/canonical: `stdSimplex ℝ (Fin n)` and `(1 : Fin n → ℝ)`;
* bridge/view: the set-builder expansion of `stdSimplex` and the coordinate formula
  `(1 : Fin n → ℝ) i = 1`.

Primitive data:
* the dimension `n`.

Derived API:
* the defining set-builder equation for `Δ[n]`;
* the coordinatewise evaluation fact for the constant-one vector, already owned by
  `Pi.one_apply`.

This item is therefore recall-first. The file keeps no parallel local wrapper such as `barE`:
the all-ones vector is canonically the function `1`, and the simplex is canonically `stdSimplex`,
with the reusable source-facing notation `Δ[n]`.
