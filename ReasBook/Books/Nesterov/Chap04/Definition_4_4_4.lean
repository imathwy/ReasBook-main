/- Domain review for this item: the dual norm already lives on the canonical owner
`StrongDual ℝ E₁`, so the main entry should recall that existing norm rather than introduce a
new wrapper.

Layer targeted by this refinement:
- source-facing recall of the canonical norm owner on `StrongDual ℝ E₁`, plus the textbook
  support-function bridge

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- mathlib `StrongDual`
- mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.sSup_unitClosedBall_eq_norm`
- mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.le_opNorm_of_le`
- project `Seminorm.dualNorm_normSeminorm_eq_norm` in `Chap02/Lemma_2_3`
- project `LinearMap.BilinForm.dualNorm_eq_sSup_primalUnitBall_strongDual` in
  `Chap04/Definition_4_2_6`

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical: the existing norm `‖·‖ : StrongDual ℝ E₁ → ℝ`

Primitive data:
- a continuous linear functional `s : StrongDual ℝ E₁`

Derived API:
- mathlib's absolute-value support formula
  `ContinuousLinearMap.sSup_unitClosedBall_eq_norm`
- the source-facing support-function formula on the symmetric closed unit ball, obtained by
  removing the absolute value using symmetry of the ball

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook dual-norm formula `sup_{‖x‖≤1} s x`
- core/canonical: the norm on `StrongDual ℝ E₁`
- bridge/view: passing from `sup_{‖x‖≤1} ‖s x‖` to `sup_{‖x‖≤1} s x` by replacing `x` with `-x`
  when needed

/- Definition 4.4.4: the dual norm on `E₁⋆` is exactly the existing norm on the continuous dual
`StrongDual ℝ E₁`. -/
#check (‖·‖ : StrongDual ℝ E₁ → ℝ)

-- Proof sketch: start from the operator-norm formula
-- `ContinuousLinearMap.sSup_unitClosedBall_eq_norm`, then use the symmetry of the closed unit
-- ball to replace `|s x|` by `s x`; in finite dimensions the resulting supremum is a maximum.
/-- Companion bridge for Definition 4.4.4: the canonical norm on the continuous dual is the
supremum of the evaluation pairing over the closed unit ball of `E₁`; in finite dimensions this
supremum is the textbook maximum. -/
