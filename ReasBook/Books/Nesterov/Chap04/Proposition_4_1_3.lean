Proposition 4.1.3 lies in first-order convex analysis on a real Hilbert space.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane` in `Chap02/Definition_2_2`
* `isMinOn_iff_eq_sInf_range` in `Chap03/Definition_3_33`
* mathlib `real_inner_le_norm`

Best owner abstraction:
* `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ f`

Primitive data:
* the objective `f`
* whole-space convexity of `f`
* differentiability of `f` at the base point where the gradient is evaluated
* for the source-facing proposition, a chosen global minimizer `xStar` witnessing that the
  canonical optimal value `sInf (Set.range f)` is attained

Derived API:
* the first-order support inequality from `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane`
* the radius estimate from Cauchy--Schwarz
* the sharper comparison-point gap estimate on a closed ball
* the optimal-value identity `sInf (Set.range f) = f xStar` from
  `isMinOn_iff_eq_sInf_range`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the suboptimality bound relative to the canonical optimal value, witnessed by a
  chosen minimizer
* core/canonical: `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane`
* bridge/view: the comparison-point estimate obtained by specializing that owner theorem to
  `Set.univ` and combining it with `real_inner_le_norm`, together with the attained-infimum bridge
  `isMinOn_iff_eq_sInf_range`

The main proposition now records the suboptimality gap against the canonical optimal value
`sInf (Set.range f)`, so the minimizer witness is mathematically active rather than an unused
binder. The sharper owner-level comparison estimate is retained only as a companion theorem.

/-- Helper for Proposition 4.1.3: for a convex function on a real Hilbert space that is
differentiable at the base point `x`, the objective gap to any comparison point within distance at
most `R` from `x` is bounded by `R` times the gradient norm at `x`. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane` at the base point `x` and comparison point
-- `y`, rewrite the resulting support inequality as a bound on `f x - f y`, and then use
-- Cauchy--Schwarz together with `‖x - y‖ ≤ R`.

/-- Proposition 4.1.3: if `f` is convex, `xStar` is a global minimizer of `f`, and `f` is
differentiable at a point `x` lying in the closed ball of radius `R` around `xStar`, then the
suboptimality gap above the optimal value `sInf (Set.range f)` is bounded by `R * ‖∇ f x‖`.
Since `xStar` attains that infimum, this is equivalent to the textbook form
`f x - f xStar ≤ R * ‖∇ f x‖`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the Chapter 3 owner bridge `isMinOn_iff_eq_sInf_range` to rewrite the
-- canonical optimal value `sInf (Set.range f)` as `f xStar`, then apply the comparison-point
-- estimate with `y = xStar`.
