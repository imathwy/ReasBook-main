Definition 2.50 lies in the local-model domain for smooth inequality-constrained minimization on
a real Hilbert space.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `FunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_1_1`, the project owner for
  an ambient feasible set together with a finite family of scalar constraints;
* `SmoothFunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem` in `Definition_2_44.lean`, the chapter owner
  carrying the ambient set `Q`, the objective `f₀`, and the finite constraint family `fᵢ`;
* `firstOrderTaylorModelAt` and `quadraticallyRegularizedObjective` in
  `Chap01/Definition_1_4_17.lean`, the canonical owners of the affine local model and its
  quadratic regularization;
* `problem.regularizedModelValue` in `Definition_2_47.lean`, the later owner value API attached
  to the same chapter-level constrained problem family.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the inequality-constrained local subproblem itself;
* core/canonical: `FunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem E m`;
* bridge/view: the feasible-set characterization obtained by unfolding the regularized affine
  constraints.

Primitive data:
* the ambient constrained problem `problem`;
* the base point `xBar`;
* the regularization parameter `γ`.

Derived API:
* the regularized first-order objective model;
* the regularized first-order constraint family;
* the inherited inequality-only feasible-set predicate.

The public owner for this numbered item is therefore the constrained local subproblem, not a raw
set-comprehension encoding of its feasible set and not its optimal value viewed as an `EReal`.
The finite constraint structure stays explicit through `m`, and the later value-level APIs are
derived from this owner layer rather than replacing it.
