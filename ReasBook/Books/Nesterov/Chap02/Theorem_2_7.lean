/- Primary domain: stage-restricted lower-complexity comparisons. The source theorem is used for
first-order arguments on `ℝⁿ`, but its statement only depends on the underlying stage sets and the
order structure of the objective values.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `Set.EqOn` in mathlib `Data.Set.Function`, the canonical owner notion of agreement on a set;
* `lowerBounds` in mathlib `Order.Bounds.Defs`, the canonical owner notion of a lower bound for an
  image set;
* `IsLeast` in mathlib `Order.Bounds.Basic`, the attained-minimum companion notion whose second
  field recovers the lower-bound data actually used here;
* `SatisfiesSpanCondition` in `Definition_2_9`, showing that linear-algebraic stage constraints
  belong upstream in the owner hypothesis that produces the stage sets, rather than in this
  comparison lemma itself;
* `coordinateSubspace` in `Text_2_13` / `Definition_2_12`, the chapter's canonical example of a
  concrete stage family whose underlying sets can later be passed to this theorem.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: a family of stage sets `𝓛 : ℕ → Set E` and a family of ordered-valued
  objectives `f`;
* core/canonical: agreement on a stage set via `(𝓛 k).EqOn ...` and lower bounds via
  `fStar k ∈ lowerBounds (f k '' 𝓛 k)`;
* bridge/view: the chapter specialization from concrete coordinate subspaces or spans to their
  underlying sets.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Theorem 2.7's comparison of `f_p (x_k)` with the stage minimum value `f_k^*`
  over a prescribed feasible stage;
* core/canonical: the owner pair `EqOn` plus `lowerBounds` on the stage image set;
* bridge/view: specializing the generic set theorem to the chapter's concrete Euclidean stage
  subspaces.

Primitive data:
* the stage sets `𝓛`,
* the objective family `f`,
* the iterate family `x`,
* the lower-bound values `fStar`.

Derived API:
* if `x k ∈ 𝓛 k`, `f p` agrees with `f k` on `𝓛 k`, and `fStar k` is a lower bound for `f k`
  on `𝓛 k`, then `f p (x k) ≥ fStar k`;
* the attained-minimum source statement is then a thin companion obtained by projecting the
  lower-bound field from `IsLeast`.

/-- Owner form of Theorem 2.7: if the `k`-th iterate lies in the stage set `𝓛_k`, the terminal
objective `f_p` agrees on `𝓛_k` with the stage objective `f_k`, and `f_k^*` is a lower bound for
the stage values `f_k` on `𝓛_k`, then `f_p (x_k) ≥ f_k^*`. -/
-- Proof sketch: since `x_k ∈ 𝓛_k`, the lower-bound hypothesis for `f_k` on `𝓛_k` gives
-- `f_k^* ≤ f_k (x_k)`; the `EqOn` hypothesis then rewrites this value to `f_p (x_k)`.
