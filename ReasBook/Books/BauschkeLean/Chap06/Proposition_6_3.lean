-- Proof sketch: if `C` is a cone then part (1) gives additive closure. Conversely, assume
-- convexity, `0 ∈ C`, and `C + C ⊆ C`; use additive closure to get closure under natural-number
-- multiples, then combine convexity with the presence of `0` to obtain closure under positive
-- dilations, yielding the textbook cone condition.

closed under pointwise addition. -/
