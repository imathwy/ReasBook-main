/- Text 1.0.35: for a topological space `X` and a point `x : X`, the family `𝓥(x)` of
neighborhoods of `x` is formalized by the neighborhood filter `nhds x`. -/
recall nhds {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (x : X) : Filter X

/-- A set belongs to the neighborhood filter of `x` exactly when it contains an open set
containing `x`. -/
-- Proof sketch: this is a direct restatement of `mem_nhds_iff`, rearranging the existential
-- witnesses into the textbook order `IsOpen U ∧ x ∈ U ∧ U ⊆ V`.
theorem mem_nhds_iff_exists_open_subset {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] {x : X} {V : Set X} :
