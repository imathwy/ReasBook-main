/-- Text 1.0.41: if `B₁` and `B₂` are bases for the given topologies on `X₁` and `X₂`, then the
family of rectangles `U ×ˢ V` with `U ∈ B₁` and `V ∈ B₂` is a basis for the product topology on
`X₁ × X₂`. This is the textbook set-builder form of the canonical theorem
`TopologicalSpace.IsTopologicalBasis.prod`. -/
