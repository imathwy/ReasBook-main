-- Proof sketch: if `x ∉ C`, then the geometric Hahn-Banach theorem gives a continuous linear
-- functional that is strictly smaller on `C` than at `x`. The Riesz representation theorem turns
-- that functional into an inner-product normal vector, producing a closed halfspace that contains
-- `C` but excludes `x`.
/-- Helper for Corollary 7.12: a point outside a closed convex set is excluded by some real closed
halfspace that still contains the set. -/
