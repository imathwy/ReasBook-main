/- Proposition 3.4: for a subset `C` of a real vector space `𝓗`, the convex hull `convexHull ℝ C`
is exactly the set of finite convex combinations of points of `C`, expressed canonically in
mathlib by `convexHull_eq` using finite centers of mass with nonnegative coefficients summing
to `1`. -/

/-- Textbook membership form of Proposition 3.4: a point lies in `convexHull ℝ C` exactly when it
is a finite center of mass of points of `C` with nonnegative weights summing to `1`. -/
