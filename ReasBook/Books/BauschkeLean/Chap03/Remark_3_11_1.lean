/-- Helper for Remark 3.11.1: if a closure point admits a best approximation in `C`, then that
best approximation must coincide with the point, so the point already lies in `C`. -/
private lemma mem_of_mem_closure_of_isBestApproximation {C : Set X} {x p : X}
    (hx : x ∈ closure C) (hp : IsBestApproximation x C p) : x ∈ C := by
  -- A closure point has zero distance to the set, so the chosen best approximation is at distance
  -- zero from the point.
  have hxp_dist : dist x p = 0 := by

  -- Zero distance identifies the point with its best approximation.

/-- Helper for Remark 3.11.1: proximinality forces `closure C ⊆ C`. -/
private lemma closure_subset_of_isProximinalIn {C : Set X} (hC : IsProximinalIn C) :
    closure C ⊆ C := by
  intro x hx
  -- Choose a best approximation for the closure point and apply the zero-distance argument.
  obtain ⟨p, hp, hbest⟩ := hC x
  exact mem_of_mem_closure_of_isBestApproximation hx ⟨hp, hbest⟩

-- Proof sketch: if `x ∈ closure C`, then `Metric.infDist x C = 0`; a best approximation
-- `p ∈ C` must therefore satisfy `dist x p = 0`, hence `x = p ∈ C`.
/-- Remark 3.11.1: a proximinal set in a metric space is closed. -/

/-- Every Chebyshev set in a metric space is closed. -/
