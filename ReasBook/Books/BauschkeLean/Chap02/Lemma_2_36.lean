/-- Lemma 2.36: a subset of a real Hilbert space is weakly compact if and only if it is weakly
closed and norm-bounded. Here weak compactness and weak closedness are expressed by viewing the set
inside `WeakSpace ℝ 𝓗`. -/
-- Proof sketch: for the forward implication, compact subsets of the weak topology are weakly
-- closed because `WeakSpace ℝ 𝓗` is Hausdorff, and compactness of all scalar evaluation images
-- gives pointwise boundedness, which the uniform boundedness principle upgrades to norm
-- boundedness. For the converse, place the bounded set inside a closed ball, use weak compactness
-- of that closed ball in a Hilbert space, and then apply closedness in the weak topology.
