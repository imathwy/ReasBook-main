/-- Corollary 2.38: for a subset `C` of a real Hilbert space, weak compactness, weak sequential
compactness, and weak closedness together with norm-boundedness are equivalent. The weak-topology
conditions are expressed by viewing `C` inside `WeakSpace ℝ 𝓗`. -/
-- Proof sketch: combine the weak compactness versus weak sequential compactness equivalence from
-- the Eberlein-Smulian theorem with the weak compactness versus weak closed and bounded
-- characterization in Hilbert spaces, and then package the resulting cycle as a `TFAE`.
