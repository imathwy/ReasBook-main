/-- Lemma 2.39: for a norm-bounded subset of a real Hilbert space, weak closedness is equivalent to
weak sequential closedness. Both notions are expressed on the image of `C` in `WeakSpace ℝ 𝓗`. -/
-- Proof sketch: the forward implication is the general fact that closed subsets are sequentially
-- closed. For the converse, place `C` inside a closed ball using boundedness, use weak sequential
-- compactness of that ball and sequential closedness of `C` to get weak sequential compactness of
-- `C`, then apply weak Eberlein-Smulian to obtain weak compactness and finally use Hausdorffness of
-- `WeakSpace ℝ 𝓗` to conclude weak closedness.
