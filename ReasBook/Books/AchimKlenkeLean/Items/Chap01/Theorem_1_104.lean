-- Proof sketch: realize the probability space by the canonical Stieltjes measure `F.measure`,
-- take `X = id`, use `Measure.map_id`, and identify the cdf of `F.measure` with `F` via
-- `ProbabilityTheory.cdf_measure_stieltjesFunction`.
/-- Theorem 1.104: Every distribution function on `ℝ` is the distribution function of a real
random variable, realized on the canonical probability space `(ℝ, 𝓑(ℝ), F.measure)`. -/
