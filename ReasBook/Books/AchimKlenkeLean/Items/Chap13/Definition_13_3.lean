/- Definition 13.3 (1): on a Borel space, the textbook "Borel measure" condition is expressed by
the canonical owner predicate `IsLocallyFiniteMeasure`. -/
recall IsLocallyFiniteMeasure

/- Definition 13.3 (2): inner regularity is the canonical owner predicate
`InnerRegular`. -/
recall InnerRegular

/- Definition 13.3 (3): outer regularity is the canonical owner predicate
`OuterRegular`. -/
recall OuterRegular

/-- Definition 13.3 (4): for measures on the Borel `σ`-algebra, the textbook notion "μ is
regular" means that `μ` is `σ`-finite and both inner regular and outer regular. -/

/- Auxiliary owner recall: mathlib also provides the bundled class `Measure.Regular μ`, which is
organized around finiteness on compact sets, outer regularity, and compact approximation of open
sets. This is not the main source-facing owner for Definition 13.3, but it remains the canonical
stronger bridge for later results. -/
