-- Proof sketch: use `MemLp.mono_exponent` to lower the exponent from `n` to `k`, then apply
-- `MemLp.integrable_norm_pow'` and rewrite the real norm as the absolute value.
/-- Remark 5.2 (1): on a finite measure space, if `X ∈ L^n`, then every absolute moment of order
`k ≤ n` is finite. In particular, the textbook probability-space clause for `1 ≤ k ≤ n` is a
special case, giving the finiteness behind the notation `M_k`. -/

/- Remark 5.2 (2): if `X, Y ∈ L²(μ)`, then their product `XY` is integrable, so the covariance is
well-defined. This is the canonical Hölder consequence `MemLp.integrable_mul`. -/
recall MemLp.integrable_mul

/- Remark 5.2 (3): for square-integrable real random variables on a probability space, covariance
can be written as `𝔼[XY] - 𝔼[X] 𝔼[Y]`. This is the canonical theorem
`covariance_eq_sub`. -/
recall covariance_eq_sub

/- Remark 5.2 (4): variance is the covariance of a real random variable with itself. This is the
canonical identity `covariance_self`. -/
recall covariance_self
