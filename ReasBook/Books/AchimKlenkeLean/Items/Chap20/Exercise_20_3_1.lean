def tauInvariantProbabilityMeasures (τ : Ω → Ω) : Set (Measure Ω) :=
  {μ | MeasurePreserving τ μ μ ∧ IsProbabilityMeasure μ}

-- Proof sketch: invariance under `τ` is preserved by nonnegative linear combinations because
-- pushforward is affine on measures, and the total mass of a convex combination of probability
-- measures is still `1`.
/-- Exercise 20.3.1 (1): the set of `τ`-invariant probability measures is convex. -/
