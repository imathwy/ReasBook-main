/-- Lemma 20.7 (1): a measurable real-valued map is `I`-measurable, with `I` the invariant
σ-algebra of `τ`, if and only if it is pointwise invariant under `τ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the characterization of measurability with respect to
-- `MeasurableSpace.invariants τ` by measurable invariant preimages; for real-valued maps, the
-- singleton fibers detect pointwise equality, and conversely pointwise invariance makes every
-- measurable preimage strictly invariant.

/-- Lemma 20.7 (2): for a measure-preserving transformation `τ` on a probability space,
ergodicity is equivalent to the statement that every real-valued `I`-measurable function, where
`I` is the invariant σ-algebra of `τ`, is almost surely constant. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `τ` is ergodic, combine part (1) with the standard mathlib theorem that an
-- ergodic invariant real-valued measurable function is almost surely constant. Conversely, test
-- the hypothesis on indicator functions of invariant measurable sets to recover the zero-one
-- characterization of ergodicity.
