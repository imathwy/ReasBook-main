/-- The event family from Example 2.9: for every `n`, the event `A_n` is that the single die roll
shows six. On the canonical model `Fin 6`, this is the constant family with value `{six_face}`. -/

/-- Each event in the family `single_roll_six_events` is the singleton event that the unique die
roll shows six. -/

/-- The limsup of the constant event family from Example 2.9 is again the singleton event
`{six_face}`. -/

/-- Example 2.9: if one rolls a die only once and lets `A_n` be the event that this single roll
shows six for every `n`, then `∑ P[A_n] = ∞` while the limsup event still has probability
`1 / 6`. This is the standard counterexample showing that independence is necessary in the second
Borel-Cantelli lemma. -/
