/- Equation (8.9): if `X : Ω → E` and `Z : Ω → ℝ` is measurable with respect to the
pullback σ-algebra `mE.comap X = σ(X)`, then the Doob-Dynkin factorization theorem
`Measurable.exists_eq_measurable_comp` provides a measurable map `φ : E → ℝ` such that
`Z = φ ∘ X`, equivalently `φ (X ω) = Z ω` for all `ω`. -/

/-- Equation (8.9) as a source-facing pointwise bridge: if `Z` is measurable with respect to
`σ(X)`, then the canonical factorization theorem yields a measurable `φ : E → ℝ` with
`φ (X ω) = Z ω` for all `ω`. -/
