-- Proof sketch: push the conditioned measure `P[|X ⁻¹' B]` forward along `X`; by
-- `Measure.restrict_map_of_aemeasurable` and `hX.map_eq` this is exactly the conditioned
-- pushforward measure `(volume[|A])[|B]`. Since `A` has finite Lebesgue measure,
-- `ProbabilityTheory.cond_cond_eq_cond_inter'` rewrites this to
-- `volume[|A ∩ B]`, which simplifies to `volume[|B]` because `B ⊆ A`.
/-- Exercise 8.3.4: Let `A, B ⊆ ℝ^n` with `B ⊆ A`. If `A` and `B` are Borel measurable,
`A` has finite Lebesgue measure and `X` has law `volume[|A]` under `P`, then under the
conditioned measure `P[|X ⁻¹' B]` the random variable `X` has law `volume[|B]`. -/
