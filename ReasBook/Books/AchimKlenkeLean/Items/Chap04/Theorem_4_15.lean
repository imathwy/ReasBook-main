/- Theorem 4.15: the canonical density-measure integrability criterion is
`MeasureTheory.integrable_withDensity_iff_integrable_smul`. For real-valued functions,
scalar multiplication is ordinary multiplication, giving the textbook formulation below. -/

/-- Theorem 4.15 companion: for real-valued `g`, integrability with respect to the density measure
`μ.withDensity f` is equivalent to integrability of the product `g f` with respect to `μ`. -/
