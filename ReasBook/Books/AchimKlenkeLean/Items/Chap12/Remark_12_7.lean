Remark 12.7 is a `bridge/view` statement: the owner abstractions are the chapter's
`nSymmetricSequenceSigmaAlgebra n` on sequence space and its pullback
`nExchangeableSigmaAlgebra X n`. The theorem below simply transports the owner-level measurable-set
criterion across `MeasurableSpace.comap`.

-- Proof sketch: unfold `nExchangeableSigmaAlgebra` as a pullback along `X`, then identify the
-- representing measurable sets via `MeasurableSpace.measurableSet_comap`, using the owner-level
-- characterization of measurable sets in `nSymmetricSequenceSigmaAlgebra`.
/-- Remark 12.7: an event belongs to the `n`-exchangeable `σ`-algebra of the sequence-valued map
`X` exactly when it admits a measurable representation `A = X ⁻¹' B` by an `n`-symmetric
measurable set of sequences. -/
