/- Definition 12.20 is organized in three layers.

- `source-facing`: conditional independence of a family of sub-`σ`-algebras is the finite-event
  factorization property below.
- `core/canonical`: under `StandardBorelSpace Ω`, this source-facing notion is equivalent to the
  owner abstraction `ProbabilityTheory.iCondIndep`.
- `bridge/view`: conditional independence of random variables is obtained by applying the
  sub-`σ`-algebra notion to the generated `σ`-algebras `σ(X i) = MeasurableSpace.comap (X i)`.
