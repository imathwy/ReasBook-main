/- Exercise 11.2.7 is `bridge/view`: the `core/canonical` owner is the almost-everywhere event
equality from `MeasureTheory.ae_mem_limsup_atTop_iff`, while the textbook symmetric-difference
formulation is the derived measure-level view given by `measure_symmDiff_eq_zero_iff`. The recall
below records that owner theorem directly, and the subsequent declarations keep only the thin
source-facing companions needed in this file. -/
-- Proof sketch: pad the event sequence by the dummy initial term `∅`, apply
-- `MeasureTheory.ae_mem_limsup_atTop_iff` to that padded sequence, and use the fact that changing
-- finitely many initial terms does not change `limsup`. This identifies `limsup A atTop` almost
-- everywhere with the event that the partial sums of the conditional probabilities
-- `μ⟦A (k + 1) | ℱ k⟧` tend to `+∞`. Then rewrite that almost everywhere equivalence as vanishing
-- symmetric-difference measure using
-- `MeasureTheory.measure_symmDiff_eq_zero_iff`.

/-- Exercise 11.2.7, source-facing AE form: the divergence event for
`∑ μ⟦A (n + 1) | ℱ n⟧` is almost surely equivalent to `limsup A atTop`. Only the tail
measurability assumptions `A (n + 1) ∈ ℱ (n + 1)` are needed; the finite initial term `A 0`
plays no role. -/

/-- Exercise 11.2.7: for a filtration `(ℱ n)` and events `A n ∈ ℱ n`, the event that the series
of conditional probabilities `∑ μ⟦A (n + 1) | ℱ n⟧` diverges to `+∞` agrees almost surely with
the tail event `limsup A atTop`; equivalently, their symmetric difference has measure zero. -/
