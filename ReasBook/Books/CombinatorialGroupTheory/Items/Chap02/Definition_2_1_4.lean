-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a presentation datum `(X; R)` together with the textbook assertions that
-- triviality and conjugacy of words on the generators are algorithmically decidable from finite
-- signed-word input.
-- `core/canonical`: the chapter owner namespace `GroupPresentation`, the word model
-- `List (X × Bool)` with canonical evaluation `FreeGroup.mk`, the canonical normal form map
-- `FreeGroup.toWord`, and the canonical owner quotient `PresentedGroup R` with its map
-- `PresentedGroup.mk`.
-- `bridge/view`: quotient triviality is the source-facing word problem, normal-closure membership
-- is the equivalent owner-side reformulation given by `PresentedGroup.mk_eq_one_iff`, and
-- quotient-level decidability of conjugacy is only a derived view obtained by choosing word
-- representatives through `PresentedGroup.mk_surjective`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. Definition `2-1-2` keeps the finiteness conditions for presentations at the canonical owner
--    predicates `Finite X` and `Set.Finite R`, while Definition `2-1-3` adds the presentation-
--    level predicate `IsRecursive` in the `GroupPresentation` namespace.
-- 2. `FreeGroup.mk` is the canonical map from finite signed words to `FreeGroup X`.
-- 3. `PresentedGroup R` with `PresentedGroup.mk` is the owner abstraction for the quotient by the
--    normal closure of `R`.
-- 4. `PresentedGroup.mk_eq_one_iff` is the canonical bridge from quotient triviality to
--    membership in `Subgroup.normalClosure R`.
-- 5. `ComputablePred` is mathlib's canonical computability predicate on coded finite input.
-- 6. `FreeGroup.toWord` is the canonical reduced-word representative of a free-group element.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the generator type `X` and relator set `R`; the owner-side computable
-- predicates are quotient triviality on signed words and quotient conjugacy on pairs of signed
-- words, while normal-closure membership and quotient-level decidability are derived bridges.
