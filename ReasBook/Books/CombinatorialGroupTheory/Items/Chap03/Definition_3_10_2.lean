Primary domain: finite list-valued Peiffer rewrites in a group.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the first-kind Peiffer formula replacing an adjacent pair `(a, b)` by
  `(b, b⁻¹ * a * b)`.
- `core/canonical`: `List G` is the owner abstraction for a finite ordered sequence, and
  `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap` is the chapter owner relation for the adjacent conjugating
  rewrite `(a, b) ↦ (a * b * a⁻¹, a)`.
- `bridge/view`: the first-kind source formula is exactly the converse relation
  `Function.swap IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap`, used downstream in the short form
  `IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap π' π`, so no parallel first-kind predicate is needed.

Domain sampling:
1. `List G` is the canonical owner for a finite sequence `(p₁, ..., pₙ)`.
2. `List.append` and list literals `[a, b]` give the cleanest source-faithful way to isolate an
   adjacent pair without separate index bookkeeping.
3. `List.prod` together with `List.prod_append` is the canonical aggregate API on a group-valued
   list.
4. `Function.swap` is the canonical owner-side operation for reversing a binary relation, so it
   captures the first-kind orientation without introducing a second predicate.
5. Group conjugation is represented directly by the standard term `a * b * a⁻¹`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the owner relation `IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap` on the two lists;
- derived API: the converse-owner recall `Function.swap IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap`, the
  source-facing bridge theorem below, and the owner invariants of length and total product.
