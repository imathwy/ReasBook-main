/-- Proposition 1-2-4: Every finite list of words in a free group can be carried by a Nielsen
transformation to an `N`-reduced list. -/
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a finite Nielsen transformation carrying `U` to an `N`-reduced finite list.
-- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroup.IsNReduced` on subsets of the ambient free group.
-- `bridge/view`: the finite target list `V` is viewed directly as the set of its entries
-- `Set.range V.get`, matching the chapter's list-based Nielsen interface.
-- Proof sketch: induct on the total word length of the list, first using multiplication moves and
-- deletion of trivial entries to force `(N1)` and `(N0)`, and then apply the lexicographic
-- refinement from the textbook to eliminate the remaining violations of `(N2)`.
