universe u

/- Proposition 1-10-6 lies in Fox calculus for free groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the faithful Fox triangular representation of `FreeGroup X`.
- `core/canonical`: `MonoidAlgebra.comapDistribMulActionSelf`, the induced `Finsupp` action on the
  Fox module, `FreeGroup.lift`, and `SemidirectProduct.rightHom`.
- `bridge/view`: the universal differential as the left coordinate of the triangular map, together
  with the pair formula `(d w, w)`.

Domain sampling:
1. `MonoidAlgebra.comapDistribMulActionSelf` is the mathlib owner for left multiplication of
   `FreeGroup X` on its integral group ring.
2. `X →₀ FreeGroupRing X` inherits the coefficientwise owner action from that ring action, so the
   previous hand-written `smul` helper was duplicate surface.
3. `FreeGroup.lift` is the owner abstraction for defining the representation from its generator
   values.
4. `SemidirectProduct.rightHom` is the owner projection detecting faithfulness.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data are the Fox module, the semidirect-product target, and the triangular
representation; the universal differential and the pair description are derived coordinate API.
