-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: Definition 5-1-2 introduces paths, closed paths, reduced paths, and simple
-- paths in a fixed `1`-complex.
-- `core/canonical`: `OneComplex` from Definition 3-2-1 is the owner abstraction for oriented
-- edges, while `Quiver.Path`, `Quiver.Path.Loop`, `Quiver.Path.IsReduced`, and
-- `Quiver.Path.IsSimple` are the canonical owner declarations for the path notions in this item.
-- `bridge/view`: `OneComplex.Path.edges` recovers the textbook sequence of oriented edges from the
-- canonical total-edge list `Quiver.Path.edgeList`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `Quiver.Path` is mathlib's canonical endpoint-aware finite path type and already includes the
--    empty path.
-- 2. `Quiver.Path.Loop` is the established owner for closed paths with a remembered basepoint.
-- 3. `Quiver.Path.IsReduced` and `Quiver.Path.IsSimple` already define the reduced/simple path
--    predicates upstream in Chapter 3.
-- 4. `Quiver.Path.edgeList` is the canonical ordered total-edge list, from which the textbook
--    oriented-edge sequence is derived.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- this item contributes no new owner object beyond the existing path API on `Quiver.Path`; the
-- only additional source-facing bridge needed here is the oriented-edge list of a path.
