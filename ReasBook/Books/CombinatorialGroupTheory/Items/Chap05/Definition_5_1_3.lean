Primary domain: combinatorial group theory of group-labelled oriented maps.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a diagram over a group is an oriented map together with a label on each
  oriented edge, compatible with reversal of orientation.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex` is the project owner for oriented maps, while the edge-reversal
  operation on its `1`-skeleton is the canonical owner for the opposite orientation of an edge.
- `bridge/view`: a diagram is used via its underlying oriented map through a coercion to
  `TwoComplex`.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex` from Definition `3-2-4` is the existing owner abstraction for oriented maps.
2. The inverse-edge owner API on the `1`-skeleton is the notation `e⁻¹`, coming from
   `OneComplex.edgeInv`.
3. A group-valued edge-labelling is naturally a function on `source.skeleton.Edge`, and the
   textbook compatibility condition is a single structure field rather than a separate wrapper.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the oriented map, the edge-label function, and the inverse-edge compatibility
  law;
- derived API: viewing a diagram as its underlying oriented map.
