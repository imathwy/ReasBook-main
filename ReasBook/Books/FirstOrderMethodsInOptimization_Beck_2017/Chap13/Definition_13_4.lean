/- Definition 13.4 is `source-facing`: the textbook introduces the chapter notation
`p(x) ∈ arg min_p {⟪p, ∇ f(x)⟫ + g(p)}` for the linearized composite subproblem.

Domain sampling in the surrounding project points to:
- Chapter 10's `composite_model_objective` as the canonical owner for pointwise objective sums;
- Chapter 8's `unconstrained_problem_solutions` as the canonical owner for global argmin sets;
- Chapter 6's `prox` and Chapter 13's later block analogue `partial_conditional_gradient_argmin`
  as the local style for source-facing set-valued minimization owners built from those canonical
  components.

The primitive source-facing data is therefore just the linearized objective. Its argmin set is a
derived source-facing view obtained by applying the Chapter 8 solution-set owner to that
subproblem, since the source does not choose a canonical minimizer. -/

/-- The generalized conditional-gradient linearized subproblem at `x`, namely the objective
`p ↦ ⟪p, ∇ f(x)⟫ + g(p)`. This is the Chapter 10 composite objective specialized to the affine
linearization term `p ↦ ⟪p, ∇ f(x)⟫`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `generalized_conditional_gradient_subproblem`; evaluation at `p` is
-- exactly the displayed linearized objective value.
/-- Evaluating the generalized conditional-gradient subproblem at `p` gives
`⟪p, ∇ f(x)⟫ + g(p)`. -/

-- Proof sketch: rewrite membership in the Chapter 8 unconstrained solution-set owner.
/-- A point `p` belongs to `generalized_conditional_gradient_argmin f g x` exactly when it
globally minimizes the objective `q ↦ ⟪q, ∇ f(x)⟫ + g(q)`. -/
