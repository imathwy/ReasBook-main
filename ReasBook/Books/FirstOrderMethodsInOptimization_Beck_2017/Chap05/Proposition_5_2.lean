/- Proposition 5.2 is `source-facing`: the mathematical object is the affine functional
`x ↦ b x + c`. The `core/canonical` owners already live upstream as Chapter 5's
`is_l_smooth_on` and mathlib's calculus API for continuous linear maps, so the derivative field is
derived directly from `ContinuousLinearMap.fderiv` and `fderiv_add_const` rather than through any
local wrapper. -/

-- Proof sketch: the Fréchet derivative of `x ↦ b x + c` is the constant map `fun _ ↦ b`, so the
-- derivative field is `0`-Lipschitz on `Set.univ`; differentiability at every point follows from
-- the standard derivative formula for continuous linear maps and addition of a constant.
/-- Proposition 5.2: every affine functional `x ↦ b x + c` on a real normed space is globally
`0`-smooth. -/
