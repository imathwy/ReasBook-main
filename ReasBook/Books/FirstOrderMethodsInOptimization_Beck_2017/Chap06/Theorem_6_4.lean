/- Theorem 6.4 is `source-facing` for the Chapter 6 proximal-operator existence theory. Domain
sampling shows that the relevant owner abstractions for this statement already live upstream:

- `IsCoerciveExtendedRealFunction` and `attains_min_on_closed_set_of_coercive` from Chapter 2,
- `proximal_objective` and the set-valued proximal map `prox[f]` from Definition 6.1.

Accordingly, this file should only state the existence theorem for `prox[f] x`; it should not
duplicate local owners for coercivity, minimizer existence, or proximal-set membership. -/

-- Proof sketch: the quadratic penalty `u ↦ (1 / 2) ‖u - x‖²` is continuous, hence closed after
-- coercing to `EReal`. Adding it to the closed function `f` yields a closed proximal objective.

-- Proof sketch: fix `x`. The function `proximal_objective f x` is coercive by `hcoercive`, hence
-- proper. It is also lower semicontinuous because `f` is lower semicontinuous and the quadratic
-- penalty `u ↦ (1 / 2) ‖u - x‖²` is continuous. Apply
-- `attains_min_on_closed_set_of_coercive` to `proximal_objective f x` on `Set.univ`; the
-- resulting minimizer belongs to `prox[f] x` by definition.
/-- Theorem 6.4: if `f` is closed and the proximal objective at `x`,
`u ↦ f u + (1 / 2) * ‖u - x‖^2`, is coercive, then the proximal set `prox[f] x` is nonempty. The
ambient assumption `[ProperSpace E]` is the canonical abstraction capturing the finite-dimensional
Euclidean setting used in the text, and the textbook properness hypothesis on `f` is redundant
once this proximal objective is assumed coercive. -/
