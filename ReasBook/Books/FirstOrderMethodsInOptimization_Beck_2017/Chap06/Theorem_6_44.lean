/- Theorem 6.44 is `source-facing` in the proximal-operator chapter, but in the local
Moreau-decomposition API the reusable owner theorem is the scaled identity
`prox_scaled_conjugate_sum_eq_singleton` from Theorem 6.45. The present file should therefore keep
only the exact textbook `λ = 1` specialization on the canonical owners `prox[...]` and `f∗`,
with the same proper-space owner assumptions rather than the stronger finite-dimensional proof
model. -/

-- Proof sketch: specialize the scaled Moreau decomposition from Theorem 6.45 at `λ = 1`. The
-- scaling terms then simplify definitionally to the unscaled proximal sets of `f` and `f∗`.
/-- Theorem 6.44: Moreau decomposition. On a proper real inner product space, for a proper closed
convex function `f`, after identifying the Fenchel conjugate with the source-facing primal-space
surface `f∗`, the pointwise sum of the proximal sets of `f` and `f∗` at `x` is the singleton
`{x}`. This is the set-valued owner-level rendering of `prox_f(x) + prox_{f^*}(x) = x`. -/
