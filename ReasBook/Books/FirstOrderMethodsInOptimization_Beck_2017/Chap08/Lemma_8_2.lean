-- Proof sketch: unfold the descent-direction hypothesis to get a negative right-limit `ℓ < 0`
-- for the directional difference quotient. Then the quotient is negative on some right interval,
-- which yields `f (x + t • d) < f x` for all sufficiently small `t > 0`. Since
-- `x ∈ interior (effective_domain f)`, a small ball around `x` lies in `effective_domain f`;
-- because `d ≠ 0` is built into the descent-direction predicate, shrinking the interval keeps
-- `x + t • d` inside that ball.
/-- Lemma 8.2: if `f : E → (-∞, ∞]` is represented by an `EReal`-valued function with no `⊥`
values, `x` lies in the interior of `dom(f)`, and `d` is a descent direction of `f` at `x`, then
`f` strictly decreases along the ray `x + t • d` for all sufficiently small `t > 0`, and those
nearby points remain in `dom(f)`. -/
