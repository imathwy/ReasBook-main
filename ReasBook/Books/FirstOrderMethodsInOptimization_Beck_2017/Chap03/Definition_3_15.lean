/- Definition 3.15 is `source-facing`: it defines the constrained extended-real objective attached
to `f` and `C`. The owner abstractions in this domain are the chapter declarations
`extendedIndicator` for the set term, `realEpigraph` for the geometric owner view, and
`is_convex_function` for the convexity predicate. Primitive data are only the original objective
`f`, the feasible set `C`, and the source-facing rule "equal to `f` on `C`, equal to `⊤` off
`C`". The identification with the canonical owner expression `f + δ_C` is derived `bridge/view`
API only: it needs the extra hypothesis that `f` never takes the value `⊥` on `Cᶜ`, because
`x + ⊤ = ⊤` in `EReal` fails exactly at `x = ⊥`. -/

-- Proof sketch: use `realEpigraph_constrained_problem_objective` to rewrite the real epigraph as
-- `(C ×ˢ univ) ∩ realEpigraph f`. Convexity of `C` gives convexity of the cylinder `C ×ˢ univ`,
-- while `hf` is convexity of `realEpigraph f`; their intersection is therefore convex.
/-- If `f` is convex and `C` is convex, then the extended-real objective associated to the
constrained problem is convex. -/
