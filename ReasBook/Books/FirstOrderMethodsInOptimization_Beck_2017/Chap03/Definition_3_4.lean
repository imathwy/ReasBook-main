/- Definition 3.4 is `source-facing` in the inequality-constrained duality API. Its primitive data
are the Lagrangian and the resulting dual objective. Chapter 2's `effective_domain` remains the
owner abstraction for finite-valued loci, but the multiplier nonnegativity condition belongs to
the separate source-facing dual-domain layer rather than being folded into the dual objective
itself. Accordingly, `q` is the raw Lagrangian infimum, while the admissible dual multipliers are
described by coordinatewise nonnegativity together with lower-finiteness of `q`. -/

def lagrangian (multiplier : MultiplierSpace) : E → ℝ :=
  fun x ↦ f x + dotProduct multiplier (g x)

-- Proof sketch: unfold `lagrangian`; the statement is exactly its defining formula.
/-- The Lagrangian is the objective value plus the Euclidean pairing of the multiplier with the
constraint vector. -/

/-- Definition 3.4: the Lagrangian dual objective function of the constrained problem
`min {f x : g x ≤ 0, x ∈ X}`. It is the infimum of the Lagrangian over `X`; the coordinatewise
nonnegativity restriction on multipliers is imposed separately in the dual-domain layer. -/
def lagrangian_dual_objective (multiplier : MultiplierSpace) : EReal :=
  sInf ((fun x : E ↦ (lagrangian f g multiplier x : EReal)) '' X)

-- Proof sketch: unfold `lagrangian_dual_objective`; the statement is exactly its defining
-- infimum formula.
/-- Evaluating the dual objective at a multiplier gives the infimum of the `EReal`-valued
Lagrangian over `X`. -/

/-- The source-facing dual domain consists of the coordinatewise nonnegative multipliers at which
the negated dual objective belongs to the Chapter 2 owner `effective_domain`. -/
def lagrangian_dual_effective_domain : Set MultiplierSpace :=
  {multiplier | ∀ i : Fin m, 0 ≤ multiplier i} ∩
    effective_domain (fun μ ↦ -lagrangian_dual_objective X f g μ)

-- Proof sketch: unfold `lagrangian_dual_effective_domain` to `effective_domain (-q)` and use the
-- `EReal` identity `-q(λ) < ⊤ ↔ q(λ) ≠ ⊥ ↔ ⊥ < q(λ)`.
/-- A multiplier lies in `dom (-q)` exactly when it is coordinatewise nonnegative and the dual
objective is greater than `-∞` there. -/
