/- Proposition 3.3 is a `bridge/view` specialization in the chapter convex-analysis API. The
owner declarations are `normal_cone`, Proposition 3.2's
`subdifferential_extended_indicator_eq_normal_cone`, and Chapter 1's canonical `dualNorm`
interface together with `exists_dualNorm_eq_apply`. The only primitive data here are the closed
unit ball and the point `x`; the dual-norm inequality description is derived API. -/

-- Proof sketch: this is the closed-unit-ball specialization of the owner theorem

cone. -/

-- Proof sketch: if `‖x‖ ≤ 1`, rewrite membership in `normal_cone (closedBall (0 : E) 1) x`
-- as `∀ z, ‖z‖ ≤ 1 → y z ≤ y x`, then use `exists_dualNorm_eq_apply` to realize the chapter owner
-- dual norm on the closed unit ball and `abs_apply_le_dual_norm_mul_norm` for the converse
-- bound. If `‖x‖ > 1`, then `x ∉ closedBall (0 : E) 1`, so the normal cone is empty by
-- definition.
/-- The normal cone of the closed unit ball is described by the chapter dual-norm inequality
`dualNorm y ≤ y x` on the ball and is empty outside the ball. -/
