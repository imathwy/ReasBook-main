/- Definition 7.22 is `source-facing`: it introduces a class of subsets of real rectangular
matrices by requiring their indicator functions to factor through the singular-value map via the
indicator of an absolutely permutation symmetric set in `ℝ^(min m n)`. The owner abstractions
already present in the project for this are `extendedIndicator`,
`Function.IsAbsolutelyPermutationSymmetric`, and `singular_value_function`. -/

/-- A set `C ⊆ ℝ^(min(m,n))` is associated to a set `T ⊆ ℝ^(m × n)` when the indicator of `T` is
the indicator of `C` composed with the singular-value map, and the indicator of `C` is absolutely
permutation symmetric. -/
def IsAssociatedSymmetricSpectralSet
    (T : Set (Matrix (Fin m) (Fin n) ℝ)) (C : Set (Fin (min m n) → ℝ)) : Prop :=
  Function.IsAbsolutelyPermutationSymmetric (extendedIndicator C) ∧
    extendedIndicator T = extendedIndicator C ∘ singular_value_function

/-- Definition 7.22: a set `T ⊆ ℝ^(m × n)` is symmetric spectral when its indicator function is
the indicator of an absolutely permutation symmetric set in singular-value coordinates composed
with the singular-value map; such a set `C` is an associated set. -/
def IsSymmetricSpectralSet (T : Set (Matrix (Fin m) (Fin n) ℝ)) : Prop :=
  ∃ C : Set (Fin (min m n) → ℝ), IsAssociatedSymmetricSpectralSet T C

-- Proof sketch: unfold `IsSymmetricSpectralSet`; the statement is exactly the existential
-- packaging of the associated-set relation introduced just above.
/-- A set of real `m × n` matrices is symmetric spectral exactly when it admits an associated set
in singular-value coordinates. -/

/-- Helper for Definition 7.22: an associated set directly provides the singular-value
factorization of the indicator of the ambient matrix set. -/
