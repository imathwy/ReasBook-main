/- Definition 12.16 is `bridge/view`: Definition 12.14 already fixes the finite-sum primal owner
as `composite_model_objective f (finite_sum_objective g)`. The present item should therefore not
rebuild the same objective from a raw lambda; it identifies that existing owner with the Chapter
12.1 block composite-model presentation obtained by taking the block space to be `E^p`,
represented in Lean by `Fin p → E`, the nonsmooth term to be the separable block sum, and the
linear map to be the diagonal duplication map.

Domain sampling identifies the existing owners:
- `core/canonical`: `composite_model_objective` for the outer two-term split;
- `core/canonical`: `finite_sum_objective` for the scalar finite-sum term from Definition 12.14;
- `bridge/view`: `separableSum g ∘ Function.const (Fin p)` for the same term in block form.

The primitive data are therefore only `f` and the finite family `g`; the block-separable term and
duplication map are derived from those owners rather than new Chapter 12 declarations. -/

/- Definition 12.16: the finite-sum problem `min_x {f x + ∑ i, g i x}` fits the Chapter 12.1
composite model by taking `V = E^p` (implemented as `Fin p → E`),
`g(x₁, ..., x_p) = ∑ i, g i (x_i)`, and `A z = (z, ..., z)`. -/

/- In source-facing form, the Definition 12.16 specialization of the Chapter 12.1 owner is
