/- Definition 12.8 is `source-facing`: it introduces the polyhedral feasible region cut out by
`A x ≤ b` in `ℝ^n` and then reuses the chapter owner `projectionPoint` for orthogonal projection
onto that set.

Domain sampling for this file identifies the relevant owner abstractions as follows.
- `inequality_feasible_set` from Chapter 3 is the canonical owner for finitely many inequality
  constraints;
- orthogonal projection onto a nonempty closed convex set is already owned upstream in Chapter 3
  by `projectionPoint` and its derived API.

Primitive data are therefore only the matrix-induced constraint family
`(i, x) ↦ A.toEuclideanLin x i - b i`; the feasible set is derived from the Chapter 3 owner, and
the projection/minimizer facts stay upstream at that owner level rather than being repackaged as
parallel local theorems here. -/

/- Definition 12.8 packages the feasible region `S = {x ∈ ℝ^n | A x ≤ b}` itself. The orthogonal
projection problem onto `S` is then handled by the upstream Chapter 3 owner `projectionPoint`
once nonemptiness, closedness, and convexity of `S` are supplied in later developments. -/
