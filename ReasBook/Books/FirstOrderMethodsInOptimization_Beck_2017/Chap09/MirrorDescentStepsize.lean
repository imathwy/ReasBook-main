/- Chapter 9 reuses two explicit mirror-descent stepsize sequences across the asymptotic-rate
items. They are not a second owner for mirror descent itself; they are source-facing named step
rules attached to the existing trajectory predicates. Keeping them in a small support owner avoids
importing a theorem file merely to reuse the canonical sequence. -/
