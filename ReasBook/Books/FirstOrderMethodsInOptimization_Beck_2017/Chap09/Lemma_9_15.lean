variable {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι]

/-
Domain sampling for Lemma 9.15 uses the existing optimization owner `IsMinOn` from mathlib and
the nearby project pattern of a concrete objective together with atomic minimizer/value lemmas, as
in `finite_intersection_orthogonal_projection_isMinOn` with its direct quadratic objective surface
and the canonical Chapter 8 argmin owner applied to
`polytope_quadratic_vertex_linear_objective`.

This item is `source-facing`: it introduces the fixed-iteration ratio objective and the constant
step family singled out by the textbook. The primitive data are the coefficients `α`, `β`, the
finite index family of steps, and the step family itself. The `core/canonical` owner for the
finite aggregation is therefore an arbitrary `Fintype`-indexed family `ι → ℝ`; the textbook
`m`-step presentation is the specialization `ι = Fin m`, not a second owner. Positivity of the
uniform family and its minimizing property are derived API, so they are stated as separate
theorems rather than bundled into one conjunction. -/
