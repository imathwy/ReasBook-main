/- `prompt_add/` is absent in this workspace, so the owner choice is sampled directly from the
nearby optimization files.

This item is `source-facing`: the textbook introduces the linear-composite minimization model
`min_x {f₁(x) + f₂(Ax)}` together with the standing assumptions that `f₁` and `f₂` are proper,
closed, and convex.

Domain sampling shows that the best owner abstraction is already upstream:
- `core/canonical`: `composite_model_objective` from Chapter 10 for two-term objectives;
- `core/canonical`: `IsADMMConvexObjectivePair` from Chapter 15 Definition 15.1 for the proper/
  closed/convex pair assumptions;
- `bridge/view`: `IsADPMMProblem` from Chapter 15 Definition 15.4, which already extends that
  same Chapter 15 owner rather than rebuilding a second regularity package;
- `bridge/view`: the source formula is the specialization
  `composite_model_objective f₁ (f₂ ∘ A)`.

Primitive data are therefore just the objective terms `f₁`, `f₂`, and the linear map `A`. The
objective itself should reuse the Chapter 10 owner directly rather than duplicating it under a
second local name, and the standing regularity assumptions should reuse the existing Chapter 15
owner rather than minting a parallel local class. -/

/- Definition 15.6: the linear-composite objective `x ↦ f₁(x) + f₂(Ax)` is the Chapter 10
composite objective specialized to `g := f₂ ∘ A`. -/
