/- Definition 1.34 is recall-only: the induced `(a,b)`-norm of a real matrix is the canonical
operator norm `‖A‖[a,b]` of the continuous linear map associated to the owner object
`Matrix.toLpLin a b`. -/
#check (‖A‖[a,b] : ℝ)

-- Proof sketch: apply `ContinuousLinearMap.unit_le_opNorm` to the continuous linear map induced by
-- `A`, then rewrite its value on a coordinate vector using `Matrix.toLpLin_toLp`.
/-- Every vector in the closed unit ball of the `a`-norm is sent to a vector whose `b`-norm is
bounded by the induced matrix norm. -/

-- Proof sketch: the closed unit ball in `WithLp a (Fin n → ℝ)` is compact, and the map induced by
-- `A.toLpLin a b` is continuous. Therefore it attains a maximum on that ball, and the preceding
-- bound identifies that maximum with `‖A‖[a,b]`.
/-- A vector in the closed unit ball of the `a`-norm realizes the induced `(a,b)`-norm. -/
