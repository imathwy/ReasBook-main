/- Definition 1.45 is recall-only: for a linear transformation on a finite-dimensional real normed
space, the textbook norm `‖A‖` is the canonical operator norm of the associated continuous linear
map `A.toContinuousLinearMap`. -/
#check (‖A‖ : ℝ)

-- Proof sketch: apply `ContinuousLinearMap.unit_le_opNorm` to the continuous linear map
-- `A.toContinuousLinearMap`; this canonical operator norm is exactly the textbook norm of `A`.
/-- Every vector in the closed unit ball is sent to a vector whose norm is bounded by the norm of
the linear transformation. -/

-- Proof sketch: the closed unit ball in the finite-dimensional normed space `E` is compact, and
-- the map `x ↦ ‖A x‖` is continuous. Therefore it attains a maximum on that ball, and the
-- preceding bound identifies that maximum with `‖A‖`.
/-- The norm of a linear transformation is the greatest norm of its values on the closed unit ball.
