-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 14.5 is a `bridge/view` recall: the Chapter 14 block composite objective
`x ↦ f x + ∑ i, g_i (x_i)` is already owned by the Chapter 10 composite objective applied to the
Chapter 6 block-separable sum.

Domain sampling identifies the relevant owner declarations:
- `composite_model_objective`;
- `composite_model_objective_apply`;
- `separableSum`;
- `separableSum_apply`.

Primitive data are only the smooth term `f` and the block penalties `g_i`. Since the source
introduces no additional owner beyond this specialization, the file should reuse those canonical
declarations directly instead of keeping a parallel Chapter 14 specialization theorem. -/

/- Definition 14.5: the Chapter 14 composite model is the canonical objective
`composite_model_objective f (separableSum g)`. -/
