/- Remark 1.70: The completion of a measure space is formalized by
`MeasureTheory.Measure.completion μ`, the canonical extension of `μ` to the `σ`-algebra of
`μ`-null-measurable sets; this completed measure is complete and matches the textbook completion
described by adjoining null sets. -/
recall MeasureTheory.Measure.completion

-- Proof sketch: for the forward direction, use
-- `NullMeasurableSet.exists_measurable_subset_ae_eq` to choose a measurable subset `A ⊆ s` that
-- agrees with `s` almost everywhere; then `s = A ∪ (s \ A)` and `μ (s \ A) = 0`. For the reverse
-- direction, measurable sets are null measurable, null sets are null measurable by
-- `NullMeasurableSet.of_null`, and null measurability is stable under unions.
/-- A set is measurable in the completion exactly when it is the union of an original measurable
set and a `μ`-null set. -/

-- Proof sketch: use `Measure.completion_apply` to rewrite the left-hand side as `μ (A ∪ N)`, then
-- apply the standard measure identity for the union of a measurable set with a null set.
/-- The completion measure assigns to `A ∪ N` the same mass as `μ` assigns to the measurable part
`A` when `N` is `μ`-null. -/
