/-- Definition 1.25: The trace `𝒜 |_ A` of a class of subsets `𝒜` of `Ω` on a set `A` is the
class of subsets of the subtype `A` obtained by restricting each member of `𝒜` to `A`, equivalently
by pulling it back along the canonical inclusion `Subtype.val : A → Ω`; here `A ↓∩ s` is Lean's
canonical subtype-level version of the intersection `A ∩ s` from (1.6). -/

/-- A subset of `A` belongs to the trace of `𝒜` on `A` exactly when it is the restriction of some
member of `𝒜` to `A`. -/
