-- Proof sketch: the forward implication is immediate because singleton sets are measurable in a
-- discrete measurable space. For the converse, use `measurable_to_countable'` on the countable
-- codomain, since every measurable set is a countable union of singleton fibers.
/-- Example 1.85 (1): Item (i). If the countable codomain `Ω'` carries the full powerset
`σ`-algebra, then `X : Ω → Ω'` is measurable if and only if every singleton fiber
`X ⁻¹' {ω'}` is measurable. -/

-- Proof sketch: if the identity map from `(ℝ, borel ℝ)` to `(ℝ, ⊤)` were measurable, then the
-- preimage of every subset of `ℝ` would be Borel. This contradicts the existence of non-Borel
-- subsets of `ℝ`.
/-- Example 1.85 (2): Item (i). For the uncountable codomain `ℝ` with the full powerset
`σ`-algebra, the identity map from `(ℝ, 𝓑(ℝ))` to `(ℝ, 2^ℝ)` is not measurable. -/

-- Proof sketch: for the forward implication, preimages of lower orthants are measurable because
