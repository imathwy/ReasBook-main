-- Proof sketch: decompose any completion-measurable set as `A ∪ N` with `A` Borel measurable and
-- `N` `volume`-null using `nullMeasurableSet_iff_exists_measurable_union_null`; the agreement on
-- Borel sets identifies the measurable part, and completeness forces the null part to remain null.
/-- Any complete measure on the Lebesgue completion of `ℝ^n` that agrees with `volume` on Borel
sets is the canonical completion `Measure.completion volume`. -/
