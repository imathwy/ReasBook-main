/-- Definition 1.68 (1): The class `nullSets μ`, corresponding to `𝓝_μ`, consists of all subsets
of measurable `μ`-null sets. Canonically, this is the collection of sets of `μ`-measure zero. -/
def nullSets (μ : Measure Ω) : Set (Set Ω) :=
  {N | μ N = 0}

/-- A set belongs to `nullSets μ` exactly when it is contained in a measurable set of
`μ`-measure zero. -/

/-- Membership in `nullSets μ` is exactly the canonical condition `μ N = 0`. -/

/- Definition 1.68 (2): “`E` holds `μ`-almost everywhere” is formalized by the canonical mathlib
notation `∀ᵐ ω ∂μ, E ω`; on a measurable set `A` one uses the restricted measure `μ.restrict A`,
and for a probability measure this is the usual almost-surely terminology. -/

/- Almost-everywhere on a measurable set is expressed by the `ae` filter of the restricted
measure. -/

/- Definition 1.68 (3): Equality modulo `μ` is the set-level almost-everywhere equality
`A =ᵐ[μ] B`, equivalently the vanishing of the symmetric-difference measure `μ (A ∆ B) = 0`. -/
