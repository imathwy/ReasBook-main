/-- Remark 1.14 (1): The set-theoretic `liminf` of a sequence of sets is the event that only
finitely many complements occur. -/
-- Proof sketch: Rewrite `liminf` along `atTop` using the standard `iSup`-`iInf` description for
-- sequences, unfold set membership, and identify eventual membership with finiteness of the set of
-- indices where `ω ∉ A n`.
theorem set_liminf_eq_finite_notMem (A : ℕ → Set Ω) :
    liminf A atTop = {ω : Ω | {n : ℕ | ω ∉ A n}.Finite} := by
  -- Transport the standard cofinite characterization along `Nat.cofinite_eq_atTop`.
  simpa [Nat.cofinite_eq_atTop] using (Filter.cofinite.liminf_set_eq (s := A))

/-- Remark 1.14 (2): The set-theoretic `limsup` of a sequence of sets is the event that infinitely
many of the sets occur. -/
-- Proof sketch: Use the standard description of `limsup` along `atTop`, unfold membership, and
-- identify frequent membership with infinitude of the set of indices where `ω ∈ A n`.
theorem set_limsup_eq_infinite_mem (A : ℕ → Set Ω) :
    limsup A atTop = {ω : Ω | {n : ℕ | ω ∈ A n}.Infinite} := by
  -- Transport the standard cofinite characterization along `Nat.cofinite_eq_atTop`.
  simpa [Nat.cofinite_eq_atTop] using (Filter.cofinite.limsup_set_eq (s := A))

/-- Remark 1.14 (3): The set-theoretic `liminf` of a sequence of sets is contained in its
set-theoretic `limsup`. -/
-- Proof sketch: If only finitely many complements occur, then membership holds for all large
-- indices, hence in particular for infinitely many indices; combine the characterizations from the
-- previous two statements.

/-- Remark 1.14 (4): The indicator of the set-theoretic `liminf` is the pointwise `liminf` of the
real-valued indicator functions. -/
-- Proof sketch: Evaluate both sides at `ω`, split on whether `ω` belongs to `liminf A atTop`, and
-- use that the resulting indicator sequence is eventually `1` or has infinitely many `0`s.
