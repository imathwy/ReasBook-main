/- Definition 1.38 (1): A measurable space is the canonical mathlib notion `MeasurableSpace Ω`,
whose measurable sets are the members of the underlying `σ`-algebra. -/
recall MeasurableSpace

variable (Ω : Type u) [MeasurableSpace Ω]

/-- A measurable space is discrete in the textbook sense exactly when the ambient type is countable
and every subset is measurable. This is the textbook wording of the canonical
`DiscreteMeasurableSpace Ω` condition. -/

/- Definition 1.38 (3): A measure space over a measurable space `Ω` is given by a measure
`μ : Measure Ω` on the canonical measurable space structure. -/
recall Measure

/- Definition 1.38 (4): A probability space is a measure space whose measure is a probability
measure, recorded in mathlib by `IsProbabilityMeasure μ`. Its measurable sets are the events. -/

/-- Definition 1.38 (5): `M_f(Ω)` is the textbook notation for the set
`{μ : Measure Ω | IsFiniteMeasure μ}` of finite measures on `Ω`. -/
