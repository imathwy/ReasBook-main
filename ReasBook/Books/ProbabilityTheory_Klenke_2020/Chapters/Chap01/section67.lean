/-- Remark 1.67: The Lebesgue measure on `ℝ^n`, formalized as `volume` on `Fin n → ℝ`, is a
regular measure. In particular, it is outer regular and inner regular on measurable sets of finite
measure. -/

  inferInstance

/-- The canonical volume measure on `ℝ^n` is outer regular: its value on a set is the infimum of
the measures of open supersets. -/
theorem volume_measure_eq_iInf_isOpen (n : ℕ) (A : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) :
    volume A = ⨅ (U : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) (_ : A ⊆ U) (_ : IsOpen U), volume U :=

/-- For the canonical volume measure on `ℝ^n`, any measurable set of finite measure is inner
regular with respect to compact subsets. -/
