open scoped Topology

/-
Remark 14.5: each coordinate projection from the product space `∀ i, Ω i` is continuous in the
canonical product topology.

/- A map into a product space is continuous exactly when all of its coordinate maps are
continuous. -/

/-- Remark 14.5: if `τ` makes every coordinate map `fun x ↦ x i` continuous, then `τ` is finer
than the canonical product topology `Pi.topologicalSpace`. Equivalently, the latter is the
coarsest topology with continuous coordinate projections. -/
