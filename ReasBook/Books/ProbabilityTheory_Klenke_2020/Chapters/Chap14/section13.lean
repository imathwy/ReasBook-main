Lemma 14.13 is a `source-facing` item in the product-measurability domain. The owner abstraction
is the measurable partial-evaluation map on a product:
`measurable_prodMk_left`, `measurable_prodMk_right`, and for function sections the derived owner
theorems `Measurable.of_uncurry_left` and `Measurable.of_uncurry_right`.

The primitive data is just measurability of partial evaluation; measurable sections of sets and
functions are derived API obtained from `MeasurableSet.preimage` and `Measurable.comp`.
