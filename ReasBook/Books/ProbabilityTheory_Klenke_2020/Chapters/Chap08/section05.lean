-- Proof sketch: use `indepSet_iff_measure_inter_eq_mul` to rewrite independence as
-- `P (A ∩ B) = P A * P B`, and use `cond_apply` with the positivity hypotheses `0 < P A` and
-- `0 < P B` to cancel the conditioning factors and obtain the two conditional-probability
-- identities. The converse implications are obtained by reversing the same calculation.

/-- Theorem 8.5: for measurable events `A` and `B` of positive probability in a probability space,
the following are equivalent: `A` and `B` are independent, `P[A | B] = P[A]`, and
