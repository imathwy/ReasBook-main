/-- Theorem 13.6: every finite Borel measure on a Polish space is a regular measure. -/
-- Proof sketch: mathlib gives the stronger owner fact `Measure.Regular μ` for finite Borel
-- measures on Polish spaces. The chapter predicate `IsRegularMeasure μ` is then obtained by
-- combining `σ`-finiteness from `IsFiniteMeasure μ` with the induced inner and outer regularity.
theorem finite_measure_regular_of_polish (μ : Measure E) [IsFiniteMeasure μ] :
    IsRegularMeasure μ :=
  IsRegularMeasure.of_owner μ

/-- Every finite Borel measure on a Polish space is a Radon measure. -/
-- Proof sketch: the same stronger owner fact `Measure.Regular μ` provides compact-set finiteness,
-- hence local finiteness on a Polish space, together with the induced inner regularity.

/-- The textbook inclusion `𝓜_f(E) ⊆ 𝓜(E)` is the owner-level fact that every finite Borel
measure on a Polish space is Radon. -/
