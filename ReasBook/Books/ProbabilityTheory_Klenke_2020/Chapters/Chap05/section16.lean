-- Proof sketch: first obtain the almost sure convergence of the empirical averages from the
-- canonical pairwise-independent strong law `ProbabilityTheory.strong_law_ae_real`; then rewrite
-- this convergence in the centered form used by `satisfies_strong_law_of_large_numbers` and use
-- the `L²` hypotheses to supply the required termwise integrability.

/-- Theorem 5.16: the textbook sequence `X₁, X₂, …`, represented by `X 1, X 2, …`, satisfies
the strong law of large numbers as soon as its terms are pairwise independent, identically
distributed, and square integrable. -/
