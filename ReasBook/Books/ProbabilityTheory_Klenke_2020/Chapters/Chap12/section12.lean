/- Remark 12.12 is `source-facing`: it records the textbook consequence for a backward martingale.
Its `core/canonical` owner layer is the martingale API on `OrderDual ℕ` together with the owner
uniform-integrability theorem `Integrable.uniformIntegrable_condExp_filtration`. The source-facing
remark below is proved directly from that owner theorem, while the textbook conditional-
expectation description of the reversed process is used only internally as a bridge. -/

variable [IsFiniteMeasure μ]

-- Proof sketch: use the previous conditional-expectation representation to identify `X` almost
-- everywhere with the family `fun n ↦ μ[X 0 | ℱ n]`, then apply uniform integrability of
-- conditional expectations of the integrable variable `X 0`.
/-- Remark 12.12: a backward martingale `(X_{-n})` is uniformly integrable, since each
`X_{-n}` is almost surely the conditional expectation of `X₀` with respect to `ℱ_{-n}`. -/
