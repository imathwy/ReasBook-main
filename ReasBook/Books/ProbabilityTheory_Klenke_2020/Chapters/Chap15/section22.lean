/- Lemma 15.22 (1): If `fₙ : E → ℝ` converges pointwise to `f` and the family `(fₙ)` is
uniformly equicontinuous, then the limit `f` is uniformly continuous. This is exactly the
canonical owner theorem `Filter.Tendsto.uniformContinuous_of_uniformEquicontinuous`. -/
recall Filter.Tendsto.uniformContinuous_of_uniformEquicontinuous

-- Proof sketch: restrict the family to the compact set `K`; uniform equicontinuity gives
-- equicontinuity there, and on a compact domain Ascoli identifies pointwise convergence with
-- uniform convergence.
/-- Lemma 15.22 (2): If `fₙ : E → ℝ` converges pointwise to `f` and `(fₙ)` is uniformly
equicontinuous, then the convergence is uniform on every compact set `K ⊆ E`. -/
