/-- Theorem 2.7 (1): If the series of the measures of the events `A n` is finite, then the
set-theoretic `limsup` event `limsup A atTop` has measure zero. -/
-- Proof sketch: Apply the first Borel-Cantelli lemma in the general measure-space form, viewing
-- `limsup A atTop` as the event that infinitely many of the `A n` occur.

/-- Theorem 2.7 (2): For an independent sequence of measurable events in a probability space, if
the series of their probabilities diverges, then the set-theoretic `limsup` event has probability
one. -/
-- Proof sketch: Use the second Borel-Cantelli lemma for an independent family of measurable sets;
-- the divergence of `∑' n, μ (A n)` forces `limsup A atTop` to have full measure.
