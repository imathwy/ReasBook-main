/- Definition 2.14: A family `(X_i)_{i ∈ I}` of random variables is independent exactly when it
is independent in the canonical mathlib sense `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun`, namely when the
generated `σ`-algebras `σ(X_i)` form an independent family. -/

/-- A family of `E`-valued random variables is i.i.d. if it is independent and every pair of
coordinates has the same distribution. -/

of variables in the family. -/
