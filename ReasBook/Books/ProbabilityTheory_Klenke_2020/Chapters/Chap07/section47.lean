/- Definition 7.47: For a real Banach space `V`, the dual space is formalized by the canonical
type `StrongDual ℝ V`, i.e. the space of continuous linear functionals `V →L[ℝ] ℝ` equipped with
its operator norm. Mathlib defines this canonically for every real normed space, hence in
particular for Banach spaces. -/
recall StrongDual

/-- The norm on the real dual space is the supremum of `|F v|` over all unit vectors. -/
