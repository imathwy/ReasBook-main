/- Corollary 7.34 (1): for `σ`-finite measures, absolute continuity is equivalent to equality with
the canonical Radon--Nikodym density; this is exactly the canonical theorem
`Measure.absolutelyContinuous_iff_withDensity_rnDeriv_eq`. -/

/- Corollary 7.34 (3): if `ν` is `σ`-finite, then `ν.rnDeriv μ` is finite `μ`-almost
