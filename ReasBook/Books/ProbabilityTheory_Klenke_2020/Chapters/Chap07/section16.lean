/-! ### Theorem_7_16 (from Items/Chap07) -/
/- Theorem 7.16: if `f ∈ ℒ^p(μ)` and `g ∈ ℒ^q(μ)` with Hölder-conjugate exponents, then
`f * g ∈ ℒ¹(μ)`. This is the canonical theorem `MeasureTheory.MemLp.mul`, specialized to the
instance `ENNReal.HolderTriple p q 1` induced by `p.HolderConjugate q`. -/

/- Theorem 7.16: Hölder's inequality for real-valued `ℒ^p(μ)` and `ℒ^q(μ)` functions is the
canonical seminorm estimate `MeasureTheory.eLpNorm_smul_le_mul_eLpNorm`. For `ℝ`-valued
functions, the pointwise scalar product `φ • f` is exactly the pointwise product `φ * f`, and the
same `ENNReal.HolderTriple p q 1` instance coming from `p.HolderConjugate q` yields the textbook
product estimate. -/
