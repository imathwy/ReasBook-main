/- Remark 7.48: a continuous linear functional on a real normed space is bounded on a
neighborhood of `0`, hence admits a global linear bound and therefore has finite operator norm.
This is the canonical boundedness theorem `ContinuousLinearMap.bound`. -/
recall ContinuousLinearMap.bound

/-- Remark 7.48: for every `δ > 0`, a continuous linear functional admits some `ε > 0` such that
`‖F‖ ≤ δ / ε`; in particular, its operator norm is finite. We state this on the canonical dual
space `StrongDual ℝ V`. -/
