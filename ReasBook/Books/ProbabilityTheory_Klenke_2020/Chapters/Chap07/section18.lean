-- `MeasureTheory.Lp.instCompleteSpace` is the canonical completeness result for `L^p` spaces over
-- any complete codomain; Theorem 7.18 is its specialization to real-valued `L^p(μ)`.
/- Theorem 7.18: for every exponent `p ∈ [1, ∞]`, the real `L^p(μ)` space equipped with its
canonical norm is complete, hence a Banach space. -/
