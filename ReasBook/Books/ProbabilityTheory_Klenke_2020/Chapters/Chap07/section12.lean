/- Example 7.12: for a real random variable on a probability space, the canonical variance theorem
`ProbabilityTheory.variance_nonneg` gives `Var[X; μ] ≥ 0`; combined with
`ProbabilityTheory.variance_eq_sub`, this is the textbook inequality
`Var[X; μ] = μ[X ^ 2] - μ[X] ^ 2 ≥ 0` for square-integrable `X`. -/
recall variance_nonneg

/- On a probability space and for square-integrable real random variables, the variance is the
textbook difference between the second moment and the square of the expectation. -/
recall variance_eq_sub

/- The same owner abstraction also provides the companion estimate `Var[X; μ] ≤ μ[X ^ 2]`. -/
recall variance_le_expectation_sq

-- Proof sketch: rewrite `Var[X; μ]` as `μ[X ^ 2] - μ[X] ^ 2` using `variance_eq_sub hX`, then
-- rearrange the canonical inequality `variance_nonneg X μ`.
/-- The second moment of a square-integrable real random variable dominates the square of its
expectation. -/
