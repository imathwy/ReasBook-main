-- Proof sketch: for `s ≤ t`, the martingale identity `E[B_t | ℱ_u] = B_u` holds for every
-- `u ∈ Ioi s`. Passing to the right-limit `ℱ_s⁺ = ⋂ u > s, ℱ_u` identifies the conditional
-- expectation of `B_t` with the almost sure limit of `B_u` as `u ↓ s`, and almost sure continuity
-- of Brownian paths turns that limit into `B_s`. Completing `ℱ_s⁺` with respect to `μ` does not
-- change conditional expectations after passing to `μ.completion`.
/-- Exercise 21.4.5: if a Brownian motion is a martingale for `ℱ`, then it is also a martingale
for the completed right-continuous filtration `ℱ^+*[μ]`, formalizing the textbook augmentation
`ℱ^{+,*}`. The filtration-side owner theorem is
`Filtration.completed_right_continuous_filtration_usual_conditions`; this is the Brownian-motion
corollary justified by the exercise. -/
