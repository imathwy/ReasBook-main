-- Proof sketch: this is the canonical owner-level theorem
-- `map_eq_iff_forall_finset_map_restrict_eq` specialized to the shifted family
-- `fun t ω ↦ X (σ t) ω`; for `I = ℕ`, `ℕ+`, or `ℤ` with `σ n = n + 1`, this is
-- exactly the textbook reformulation of (20.1) as equality of the full process laws.
/-- Remark 20.2: for index sets such as `ℕ`, `ℕ+`, or `ℤ`, condition `(20.1)` is equivalent to the
equality of the law of the shifted process `(X_{n+1})` and the law of the original process
`(X_n)`. Here this is stated in the canonical process-law form for an arbitrary self-map `σ` on the
index set. -/
