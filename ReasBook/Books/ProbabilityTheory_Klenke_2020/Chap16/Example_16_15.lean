-- Proof sketch: Example 16.15's Gamma-root vague-limit discussion is driven by the
-- Lévy--Khinchin representation guaranteed by Theorem 16.14 for infinitely divisible laws on
-- `[0, ∞)`.
/-- Example 16.15: the Gamma-root vague-limit discussion rests on the fact that every infinitely
divisible probability law on `[0, ∞)` admits a Lévy--Khinchin pair `(α, ν)` in the sense of
