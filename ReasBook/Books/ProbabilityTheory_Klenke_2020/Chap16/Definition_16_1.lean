/- Definition 16.1 is organized around a canonical owner and two source-facing views.

- `IsCFP` is the source-facing notion of a characteristic function on `ℝ`.
- `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.IsInfinitelyDivisible` is the `core/canonical` owner
  predicate on laws in an additive measurable space.
- `IsInfinitelyDivisibleCFP` and `IsInfinitelyDivisibleRandomVariable` are the two
  `bridge/view` formulations used in the chapter.

The refinements below keep the source-facing bridge notions, but route their owner-side API
through canonical `ProbabilityMeasure` constructions instead of parallel local wrappers.

the Fourier transform of some probability measure on `ℝ`. -/
