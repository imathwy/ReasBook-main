-- Proof sketch: choose an arbitrary convolution root `ν` of order `n`; since `μ` is supported on
-- `Icc a b`, the law `ν` is supported on an interval of width `(b - a) / n`, so
-- `Var[id; (ν : Measure ℝ)] ≤ ((b - a) / n)^2 / 4`. Passing to the `n`-fold convolution power and
-- using additivity of variance forces `Var[id; (μ : Measure ℝ)] = 0`, hence `μ` is Dirac.
/-- If an infinitely divisible probability measure on `ℝ` has full mass on a compact interval,
then it is a Dirac mass at a point of that interval. -/

-- mass, then apply `eq_diracProba_of_isInfinitelyDivisible_of_measure_Icc_eq_one`.
/-- Exercise 16.1.1: an infinitely divisible probability distribution on `ℝ` that is concentrated
on a bounded interval is a Dirac measure. -/
