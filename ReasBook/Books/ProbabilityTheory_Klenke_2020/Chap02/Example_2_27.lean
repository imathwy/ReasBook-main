-- Proof sketch: first use `iIndepFun_adjacent_pairs_of_iIndepFun` to obtain independence of the
-- pair process `n ↦ (X (2 * n + 2), X (2 * n + 1))`, then postcompose each pair with the
-- measurable subtraction map `(x, y) ↦ x - y` via `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun.comp`.
/-- Example 2.27: with Lean's `0`-based indexing, the textbook family
`(X_{2n} - X_{2n-1})_{n ∈ ℕ}` is rendered as
`(X (2 * n + 2) - X (2 * n + 1))_{n ∈ ℕ}`; this adjacent-pair difference family is independent
whenever `X` is an independent family of real random variables. -/
