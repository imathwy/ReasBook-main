/-- A family `X : Fin n → Ω → ℝ` under a measure `P` realizes the laws `μ` when each coordinate is
measurable, has law `μ i`, the family is independent, and `P` is a probability measure. -/

    (μ : Fin n → Measure ℝ) (P : Measure Ω) (X : Fin n → Ω → ℝ) : Prop where
  measurable : ∀ i, Measurable (X i)
  hasLaw : ∀ i, HasLaw (X i) (μ i) P
  indep : iIndepFun X P
  isProbabilityMeasure : IsProbabilityMeasure P

/-- Corollary 2.23: Any finite family of probability measures on `ℝ` can be realized as the laws of
an independent family of real-valued random variables on a common probability space. -/
-- Proof sketch: specialize `ProbabilityTheory.exists_hasLaw_indepFun` to the finite index type
-- `Fin n` and the constant target space `ℝ`, then package the resulting measurability, law,
-- independence, and probability-space properties into `IndependentRealLawFamily`.
