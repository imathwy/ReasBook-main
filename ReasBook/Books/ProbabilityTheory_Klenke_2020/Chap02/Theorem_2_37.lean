/-- Theorem 2.37: Kolmogorov's 0--1 law in the canonical sequence form for a countably infinite
family of independent sub-`σ`-algebras. Any event measurable with respect to the tail
`σ`-algebra `limsup ℱ atTop = ⋂ n, ⋃ k ≥ n, ℱ k` has probability `0` or `1`. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply the canonical mathlib theorem
-- `ProbabilityTheory.measure_zero_or_one_of_measurableSet_limsup_atTop`, which states the 0--1
-- law for an independent sequence of sub-`σ`-algebras indexed by `ℕ`.
