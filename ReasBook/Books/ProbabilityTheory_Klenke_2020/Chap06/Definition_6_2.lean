converges in the canonical mathlib sense for every restricted finite measure `μ.restrict A` with

variable (μ : Measure Ω) (fSeq : ℕ → Ω → E) (f : Ω → E)

/- Definition 6.2 (2): A sequence `fₙ : Ω → E` converges to `f` `μ`-almost everywhere if for
`μ`-almost every `ω`, the pointwise sequence `fₙ ω` tends to `f ω`. For a probability measure,
this is almost sure convergence. -/
