-- Proof sketch: for each time `n`, every summand with `k < n` is `ℱ n`-measurable because
-- `H (k + 1)` is `ℱ k`-measurable by predictability and hence `ℱ n`-measurable by monotonicity,
-- while both `X (k + 1)` and `X k` are `ℱ n`-measurable by adaptedness. Finite sums preserve
-- measurability.
/-- Remark 9.38: the discrete stochastic integral `H · X` of a predictable real-valued process
`H` against an adapted real-valued process `X` is itself adapted to the filtration `ℱ`. -/
