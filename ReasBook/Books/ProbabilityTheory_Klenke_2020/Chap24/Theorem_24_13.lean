/-- Theorem 24.13: for an atom-free boundedly finite intensity `μ` and a random measure `X` whose
measurable-set evaluations are almost surely in `ℕ₀ ∪ {∞}`, the Poisson point-process property is
equivalent to having no double points and the Poisson void probabilities on bounded measurable
sets. -/
