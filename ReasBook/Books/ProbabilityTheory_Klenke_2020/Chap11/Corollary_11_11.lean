-- Proof sketch: use Theorem 10.4 to identify the expectations of the canonical square variation
-- with the variances of the martingale increments via
-- `squareVariation_expectation_eq_variance`, so (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Then apply the
-- owner martingale convergence theorem
-- `MeasureTheory.martingale_convergence_to_memLp_limitProcess_of_lp_bounded` at `p = 2` to pass
-- from uniform `L²` boundedness to almost-sure and `L²` convergence, while the implications
-- `(iv) → (iii) → (i)` are immediate.
/-- Corollary 11.11: for a square-integrable discrete-time martingale with canonical square
variation process `⟨X⟩[ℱ, μ]`, the following are equivalent:
(i) the second moments `μ[(X n)^2]` are uniformly bounded;
(ii) the expectations of the square variation converge to a finite limit;
(iii) the martingale converges in `L²` to the canonical limit `ℱ.limitProcess X μ`;
(iv) the martingale converges almost surely and in `L²` to `ℱ.limitProcess X μ`. -/
