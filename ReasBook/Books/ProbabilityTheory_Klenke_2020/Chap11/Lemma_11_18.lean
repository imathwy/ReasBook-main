/- Lemma 11.18 is `source-facing`: it is about the normalized branching population
`W_n = Z_n / m^n`. Its `core/canonical` owners are the martingale API for
`Filtration.natural Z hZ_sm` and the discrete-time constructor `martingale_nat`. The abbreviation
below is only the minimal `bridge/view` layer needed to keep the textbook notation reusable in the
later branching-process items of this chapter. -/
/-- The normalized branching-process sequence `W_n = Z_n / m^n` attached to a real-valued
generation-size process `Z`. -/
