/- This item is `source-facing`: it describes a `{0,1}`-valued real process together with its
one-step conditional law. The public owner abstraction is therefore the transition-law
predicate `exercise1128Transition`, which packages both the binary state-space restriction and the
displayed conditional law along the natural filtration. The ambient-`ℝ` two-point row kernel below
is auxiliary support code for that statement, so it stays private. -/
