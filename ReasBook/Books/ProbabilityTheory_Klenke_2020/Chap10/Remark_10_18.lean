-- Proof sketch: since `stoppedValue X τ_b` is almost surely the constant `b`, its conditional
-- expectation with respect to `ℱ 0` is also almost surely the constant `b` by `condExp_const`.
-- The strict inequality `X 0 < b` almost surely then rules out almost-sure equality between
-- `X 0` and that conditional expectation.
/-- Remark 10.18: if the stopped value `X_{τ_b}` is almost surely the constant level `b` and the
initial value `X_0` is almost surely strictly smaller than `b`, then the optional-sampling
equality at time `0` fails for this stopped process. This formalizes the remark's warning that the
optional sampling conclusion can fail for an unbounded stopping time on a nontrivial finite
measure space. -/
