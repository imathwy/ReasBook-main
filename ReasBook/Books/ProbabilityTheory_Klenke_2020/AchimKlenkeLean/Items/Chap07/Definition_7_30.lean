/- Definition 7.30: For measures `μ` and `ν` on a measurable space, the textbook relation
`ν ≪ μ` of absolute continuity is the canonical mathlib predicate
`MeasureTheory.Measure.AbsolutelyContinuous ν μ`. Equivalent measures are characterized by mutual
absolute continuity, equivalently by equality of the almost-everywhere filters `ae μ = ae ν`, and
singularity is the canonical predicate `μ ⟂ₘ ν`. -/
