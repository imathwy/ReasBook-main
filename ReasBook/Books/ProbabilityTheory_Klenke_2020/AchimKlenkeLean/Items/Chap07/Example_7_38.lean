-- Proof sketch: `gaussianReal 0 1 = volume.withDensity (gaussianPDF 0 1)`, and the Gaussian
-- density is everywhere positive and finite, so applying `withDensity_inv_same` yields the
-- reciprocal-density representation of Lebesgue measure.
/-- Example 7.38 (1): Lebesgue measure is obtained from the standard normal law on `ℝ` by the
reciprocal Gaussian density. -/
theorem standardNormal_withDensity_inv_eq_volume :
    (gaussianReal 0 1).withDensity (fun x ↦ (gaussianPDF 0 1 x)⁻¹) = volume := by

    (ae_of_all _ fun x ↦ gaussianPDF_ne_top)

/- Example 7.38 (2): Lebesgue measure on `ℝ` is absolutely continuous with respect to the
standard normal law; more generally, mathlib's canonical theorem
`gaussianReal_absolutelyContinuous'` gives `volume ≪ gaussianReal μ v` for every nondegenerate
real Gaussian, and the textbook statement is the specialization `μ = 0`, `v = 1`. -/

  volume ≪ gaussianReal μ v

-- Proof sketch: the sets `Ici (n : ℝ)` are decreasing with empty intersection, and
-- `gaussianReal 0 1` is a finite measure; continuity from above gives convergence of their masses
-- to `0`.
/-- Example 7.38 (3): The right-tail masses of the standard normal law converge to `0`. -/

/- Example 7.38 (4): Every right tail `[a, ∞)` has infinite Lebesgue measure; the textbook
`n : ℕ` case is the specialization `a = n` of the canonical theorem `Real.volume_Ici`. -/
recall Real.volume_Ici (a : ℝ) : volume (Ici a) = ∞

-- Proof sketch: if `volume` were totally continuous with respect to `gaussianReal 0 1`, then the
-- vanishing standard-normal tails from `standardNormal_rightTail_tendsto_zero` would force the
-- Lebesgue masses of the same tails to become arbitrarily small. This contradicts
-- `Real.volume_Ici`.
/-- Example 7.38 (5): Lebesgue measure is not totally continuous with respect to the standard
normal law. -/
