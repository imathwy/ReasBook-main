/- Definition 7.6: For a function `φ : E → ℝ` on a convex set `G`, the textbook notion of
convexity is the canonical mathlib predicate `ConvexOn ℝ G φ`, expressing
`φ (λ • x + (1 - λ) • y) ≤ λ • φ x + (1 - λ) • φ y` for points `x, y ∈ G` and
coefficients `λ ∈ [0,1]`. -/
recall ConvexOn

/- The corresponding notion of a concave function on a convex set is the canonical predicate
`ConcaveOn ℝ G φ`. -/
recall ConcaveOn

/- The textbook formulation that `φ` is concave exactly when `-φ` is convex is the standard
mathlib equivalence `neg_convexOn_iff`. -/
recall neg_convexOn_iff
