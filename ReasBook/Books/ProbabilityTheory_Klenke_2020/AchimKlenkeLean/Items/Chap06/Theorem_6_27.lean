-- Proof sketch: apply `continuousAt_of_dominated` to the parameter-first family `x ↦ f x`,
-- using integrability of each section to obtain a.e.-strong measurability and the common
-- integrable majorant `bound` for domination.
/-- Theorem 6.27: if each section `ω ↦ f x ω` is integrable, `x ↦ f x ω` is continuous at `x₀`
for almost every `ω`, and all sections are almost everywhere dominated by a single integrable
function `bound`, then the parameter integral `x ↦ ∫ ω, f x ω ∂μ` is continuous at `x₀`. -/
