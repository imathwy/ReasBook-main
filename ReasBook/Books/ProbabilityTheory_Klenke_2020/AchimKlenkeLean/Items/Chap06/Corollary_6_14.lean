its sequential convergence is equivalent to `μ`-almost-everywhere convergence for every measurable
sequence and measurable limit. -/

-- Proof sketch: assume such a topology `τ` exists. Choose a witness to the failure of almost-
-- everywhere convergence despite convergence in measure. By the right-to-left direction of the
-- induced-convergence hypothesis, the sequence does not converge to its limit in `τ`, so some
-- open neighborhood of the limit misses infinitely many terms. A subsequence outside that
-- neighborhood still converges in measure; Corollary 6.13 yields a further subsequence converging
-- almost everywhere, hence by the left-to-right direction it converges to the limit in `τ`,
-- contradicting eventual membership in every neighborhood.
/-- Corollary 6.14: On a sigma-finite measure space, if convergence in `μ`-measure on every
measurable set of finite `μ`-measure does not coincide with `μ`-almost-everywhere convergence for
measurable maps into a separable metric space, then no topology on the set of measurable maps
`Ω → E` induces almost-everywhere convergence. -/
