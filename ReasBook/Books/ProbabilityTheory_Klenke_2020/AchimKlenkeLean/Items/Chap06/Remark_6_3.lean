-- Proof sketch: the textbook monotone finite-measure exhaustion is stronger than needed here; the
-- actual almost-everywhere equivalence is exactly the canonical restricted-measure `iUnion`
-- statement.
/-- Remark 6.3: if a countable family of sets `A n` covers `univ`, then `f n` converges to `g`
almost everywhere with respect to `μ` if and only if this convergence holds almost everywhere with
respect to each restricted measure `μ.restrict (A n)`. -/
