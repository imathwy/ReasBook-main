-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Exercise 8.2.1 (1): If `X⁻` is integrable, then the lower conditional expectation is the
almost-sure limit of the conditional expectations of any admissible increasing integrable
approximation, hence is independent of the chosen approximation sequence. -/

/- Exercise 8.2.1 (2): For integrable `X`, the lower-integrable extension from Remark 8.16 agrees
almost surely with the usual conditional expectation `P[X | ℱ]`. -/

/- Exercise 8.2.1 (3): The lower-integrable conditional expectation is monotone with respect to
almost-sure order. This is the monotonicity assertion from Remark 8.16. -/
