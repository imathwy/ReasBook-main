/-- Definition 17.1: a process has the Markov property with respect to a filtration `ℱ` if, for
it is adapted to `ℱ`, and for every measurable set `A` and all times `s ≤ t`, the conditional
probability of the future event `{X_t ∈ A}` given `ℱ s` agrees almost surely with the conditional
probability given the present state `X s`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `HasMarkovProperty`; this is the defining adaptedness plus conditional-
-- probability identity written as an explicit `↔`, which is the useful elimination form for later
-- rewriting.
/-- Having the Markov property is equivalent to adaptedness together with the conditional-
probability identity for all measurable state events and all times `s ≤ t`. -/
