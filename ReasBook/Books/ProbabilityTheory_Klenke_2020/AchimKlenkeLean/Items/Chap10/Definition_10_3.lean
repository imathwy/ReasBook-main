Definition 10.3 is `source-facing`: for a square-integrable discrete-time real martingale `X`,
its square variation is the canonical predictable compensator of the squared process. The
`core/canonical` owner layer is mathlib's `predictablePart`; the predicate
`IsSquareVariationProcess` below is only a thin `bridge/view` for source-style witness statements.
