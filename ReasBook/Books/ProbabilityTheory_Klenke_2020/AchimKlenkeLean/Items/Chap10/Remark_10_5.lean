local notation "squareProcess" => fun n ω ↦ (X n ω) ^ 2

-- Proof sketch: the predictable part is the cumulative sum of the conditional expectations of the
-- increments of the squared process. Since `(X_n^2)` is a submartingale, those conditional
-- expected increments are almost surely nonnegative, so the predictable part is almost surely
-- monotone increasing in time.
/-- Remark 10.5: in the setting of Example 10.2, if the squared process `(X_n^2)` is a
submartingale, then its predictable part is almost everywhere monotone increasing in time. This is
the textbook increasing process associated with the squared process. -/
