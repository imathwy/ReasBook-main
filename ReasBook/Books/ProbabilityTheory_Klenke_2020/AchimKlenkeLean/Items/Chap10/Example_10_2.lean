local notation "squareProcess" => fun n ω ↦ (X n ω) ^ 2

-- Proof sketch: apply the canonical Doob decomposition construction to the squared process
-- `n ↦ X n ^ 2`. Its predictable part is predictable and starts at `0`, while the compensated
-- process `X_n^2 - ⟨X⟩_n` is the canonical martingale part of the squared process.
/-- For a square-integrable discrete-time martingale `X`, subtracting the canonical square
variation `⟨X⟩` from the squared process yields a martingale. -/

-- Proof sketch: combine the canonical owner facts `squareVariation_zero`,
-- `squareVariation_predictable`, and `square_sub_squareVariation_martingale`.
/-- Example 10.2: for a square-integrable discrete-time martingale `X`, the canonical square
variation `⟨X⟩` realizes the textbook square-variation process of `X`. -/
