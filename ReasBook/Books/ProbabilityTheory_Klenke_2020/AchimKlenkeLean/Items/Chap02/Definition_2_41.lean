/-- Definition 2.41: percolation occurs for a configuration when some open cluster in `ℤ^d`
is infinite. This is the event whose probability is denoted by `ψ(p)` in the text. -/
def percolationOccurs (cluster : LatticePoint d → Ω → Set (LatticePoint d)) : Set Ω :=
  {ω | ∃ x : LatticePoint d, Set.Infinite (cluster x ω)}

/-- The probability `ψ(p)` that percolation occurs, defined as the probability of the event that
there exists an infinite open cluster. -/

/-- Translation invariance of the infinite-cluster marginals: the probability that a given site
belongs to an infinite open cluster does not depend on the site. -/

/-- Translation invariance of the infinite-cluster marginals means exactly that each site has the
same infinite-cluster marginal as the origin. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `percolationProbability` and `percolationOccurs`; the statement is the
-- defining equation for `ψ(p)`.
/-- The percolation probability is the probability of the event that some open cluster is
infinite. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply the translation-invariance hypothesis at the site `y`; the right-hand side
-- is exactly the probability appearing in equation (2.13).
/-- Under translation invariance, the probability that the origin lies in an infinite open cluster
agrees with the corresponding probability at any lattice site. -/
