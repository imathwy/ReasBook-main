/- Remark 2.15 (1): a family of random variables is independent exactly when every finite subfamily
satisfies the usual product formula for measurable preimages. This is the canonical theorem
`ProbabilityTheory.iIndepFun_iff_measure_inter_preimage_eq_mul`. -/

/-- Remark 2.15 (2): if a family of `σ`-algebras is independent and each `X i` is measurable with
respect to the corresponding `σ`-algebra, then the family `X` is independent. -/
