/-- Definition 25.41: a set `A ⊆ E` is polar for the family of laws `P x` and the `E`-valued
process `W` if, for every starting point `x`, the strictly positive hitting time of `A` is almost
surely infinite under `P x`. In the chapter's Brownian-motion applications, `E = ℝ^d`. -/
def IsPolarSet (P : E → ProbabilityMeasure Ω) (W : NNReal → Ω → E) (A : Set E) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : E, ∀ᵐ ω ∂(P x : Measure Ω), (τ_[W, A]) ω = ⊤

-- Proof sketch: `IsPolarSet` is defined through the canonical owner `strictHittingTime`; the
-- source-facing path-avoidance formulation is exactly `strictHittingTime_eq_top_iff` under each
-- starting law `P x`.
/-- A set is polar exactly when, under each starting law `P x`, the path avoids the set at every
strictly positive time almost surely. -/
