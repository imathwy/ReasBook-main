/-- Lemma 9.23: for a countable time index set, evaluating an adapted process at a finite
stopping time gives a random variable that is measurable with respect to the stopping-time
σ-algebra `𝓕_τ`. Here finiteness is encoded by taking `τ : Ω → ι` and viewing it as a
`WithTop ι`-valued stopping time. -/
-- Proof sketch: for a measurable set `A` and time `t`, rewrite
-- `{ω | X (τ ω) ω ∈ A} ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ t}` as the countable union over `s ≤ t` of
-- `{ω | τ ω = s} ∩ X s ⁻¹' A`; adaptedness gives measurability of `X s ⁻¹' A` in `ℱ s`, and the
-- stopping-time property gives measurability of `{τ = s}` in `ℱ s`.
