-- Proof sketch: from `IsSetAlgebra A`, use `univ_mem` and `isSetRing`; conversely, recover
-- `empty_mem` from `Set.univ \ Set.univ = Set.empty`, obtain complements as `Set.univ \ s`,
-- and keep binary unions from the `IsSetRing` structure.
/-- The textbook formulation is equivalent to saying that `A` contains `univ` and is a ring of
sets. -/
