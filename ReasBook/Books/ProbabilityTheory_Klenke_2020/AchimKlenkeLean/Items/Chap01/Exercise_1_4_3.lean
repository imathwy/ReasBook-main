-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

-- Proof sketch: the hypothesis identifies `f'` with the canonical derivative `deriv f` via
-- `deriv_eq hderiv`. Then apply the existing mathlib theorem `measurable_deriv f`.
/-- Exercise 1.4.3: If `f : ℝ → ℝ` has pointwise derivative `f'`, then `f'` is Borel measurable,
i.e. measurable from `B(ℝ)` to `B(ℝ)`. -/
