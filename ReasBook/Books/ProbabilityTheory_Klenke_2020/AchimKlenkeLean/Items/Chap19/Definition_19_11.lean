/-- Definition 19.11: a transition matrix `p` is the random walk on `E` with weights `C` when
`C` is symmetric and the transition probabilities are given by the normalization formula
`p (x, y) = C (x, y) / C (x)` from Example 19.10. The textbook finiteness condition on each
total conductance `C (x)` is recovered below from these axioms together with stochasticity. -/

theorem IsRandomWalkWithWeights.isStochasticMatrix
    {p C : E → E → ℝ≥0∞} (h : IsRandomWalkWithWeights p C) :
    IsStochasticMatrix p :=
  h.isStochastic

-- Proof sketch: if `conductance C x = ∞`, then `transition_eq` forces every entry in the `x`-row
-- of `p` to vanish, so its row sum is `0`, contradicting the stochasticity condition
-- `∑' y, p x y = 1`.
/-- In a random walk with weights, each total conductance is automatically finite. -/

and nonadjacent vertices carry weight `0`. -/
def simpleGraphWeights (G : SimpleGraph E) : E → E → ℝ≥0∞ :=
  fun x y ↦ if G.Adj x y then 1 else 0

-- Proof sketch: use symmetry of adjacency in a simple graph to rewrite
-- `G.Adj x y ↔ G.Adj y x`, then both indicator-style cases coincide.
/-- The unit edge weights of a simple graph are symmetric. -/

/-- A transition matrix is a simple random walk on `(E, K)` when its weights are the indicator of
the edge relation of the graph. -/
