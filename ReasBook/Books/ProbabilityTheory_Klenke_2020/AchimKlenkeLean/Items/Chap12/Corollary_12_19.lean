/- Corollary 12.19 is a `bridge/view` statement: the Chapter 12 owner
`exchangeableSigmaAlgebra (Function.swap X)` is reduced by Corollary 12.18 to the Chapter 2 owner
`tailRandomVariableMeasurableSpace X`, and the latter is handled by the canonical tail `0`-`1`
law from Theorem 2.37. -/

-- Proof sketch: `exchangeableFamily_of_isIID` upgrades the i.i.d. hypothesis to the chapter owner
-- `IsExchangeable`, and Corollary 12.18 then replaces an exchangeable event by an a.e.-equal tail
-- event. Since the coordinates are measurable, Theorem 2.37 applies to that tail event.
/-- Corollary 12.19: for a measurable i.i.d. sequence `X`, every event measurable with respect to
the exchangeable `σ`-algebra of `X` has probability `0` or `1`. This is the Hewitt--Savage `0`-`1`
law. -/
