Definition 24.3 is source-facing: it keeps the textbook random measure as a measure-valued random
variable, while the measurable owner abstraction for that ambient data is the canonical kernel
object `Kernel Ω E`.

/-- Definition 24.3: a random measure on `E` under the probability law `P` is a measurable
`Measure E`-valued random variable whose values are locally finite almost surely. Mathlib's
canonical measurable-space structure on `Measure E` and the owner abstraction `Kernel Ω E`
model the measurable part of the textbook ambient space `\widetilde{\mathcal M}(E)`, while the
almost-sure local-finiteness clause formalizes `\mathbf{P}[X \in \mathcal{M}(E)] = 1`. -/
