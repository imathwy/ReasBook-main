-- Proof sketch: this is the one-dimensional specialization of the canonical Skorohod-coupling
-- theorem from Chapter 17.
/-- Exercise 13.2.14: if probability measures `μs n` on `ℝ` converge weakly to `μ`, then there
exists a probability space carrying real random variables with laws `μ` and `μs n` whose sample
paths converge almost surely to the limit random variable. -/
