-- Proof sketch: compactness of `E` makes every family of measures tight, so Theorem 13.29 gives a
-- convergent subsequence for any sequence of subprobability finite measures. The mass bound is
-- preserved in the limit because `μ ↦ μ.mass` is continuous and `{t : NNReal | t ≤ 1}` is closed.
/-- Corollary 13.30 (1): for a compact metric space `E`, the textbook set `\mathcal{M}_{\le 1}(E)`
of sub-probability measures is weakly sequentially compact, viewed canonically as the set of finite
measures on `E` with total mass at most `1`. -/

/- Corollary 13.30 (2): for a compact metric space `E`, the textbook set `\mathcal{M}_1(E)` of
probability measures is weakly sequentially compact; in mathlib this is the canonical weak space
`ProbabilityMeasure E`, carrying the corresponding `SeqCompactSpace` instance. -/
