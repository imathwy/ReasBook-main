/- Remark 13.27 (1): for a Polish space, singleton families of finite Borel measures are tight by
the canonical owner theorem `MeasureTheory.isTightMeasureSet_singleton`. -/
recall MeasureTheory.isTightMeasureSet_singleton

-- Proof sketch: every singleton subfamily is tight by Remark 13.27 (1), and
-- `IsTightMeasureSet` is stable under finite unions. Induct on the finite set `S` to obtain
-- tightness of the whole family.
/-- Remark 13.27 (2): if `E` is Polish, then every finite family of finite measures on `E` is a
tight set of measures. -/
