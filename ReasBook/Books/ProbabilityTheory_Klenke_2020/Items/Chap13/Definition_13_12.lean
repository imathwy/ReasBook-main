/- Definition 13.12 (1): weak convergence of finite measures is the canonical convergence notion
`Tendsto μs atTop (𝓝 μ)` on `FiniteMeasure E`; its textbook test-function characterization is the
owner theorem `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.tendsto_iff_forall_integral_tendsto`. -/
recall MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.tendsto_iff_forall_integral_tendsto

/-- Definition 13.12 (2): a sequence of Radon measures on the metric space `E` converges vaguely
to `μ` when the integrals of all compactly supported continuous real-valued test functions
converge to the corresponding integral against `μ`. -/

-- Proof sketch: this is just the defining conjunction for vague convergence, recording both the
-- Radon-measure domain conditions and the convergence of compactly supported continuous test
-- function integrals.
/-- Vague convergence of Radon measures means exactly convergence of integrals against all
compactly supported continuous real-valued test functions, together with the ambient Radon-measure
assumptions on the sequence and its limit. -/
