-- Proof sketch: if `f` is compactly supported, then its support is contained in some compact
-- interval `[-R, R]`. For all sufficiently large `n`, the restriction of Lebesgue measure to
-- `[-n, n]` agrees with Lebesgue measure on the support of `f`, so the test-function integrals are
-- eventually constant and equal to the integral against `volume`.

converge vaguely to Lebesgue measure on `ℝ`. -/

-- Proof sketch: weak convergence of finite measures would force convergence of the integrals of the
-- bounded continuous test function `1`, hence convergence of the total masses. But
-- the finite measure `truncatedLebesgueFiniteMeasure n` has mass `2n`,
-- so the masses diverge and no weak limit in `FiniteMeasure ℝ` can exist.
