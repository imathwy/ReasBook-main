/- Equation (8.4) is `source-facing`: for `X ∈ L¹(P)` and an event `A ∈ 𝒜`, the truncated
expectation `𝔼[X; A] := 𝔼[1_A X]` is represented in Lean by the canonical expectation
`P[A.indicator X]`. Its `core/canonical` owner abstractions are `MeasureTheory.integral` and
`MeasureTheory.integral_indicator`; the set-integral identity is the `bridge/view` connecting the
textbook notation to that owner API. -/

/-- Equation (8.4): the truncated expectation `𝔼[X; A]` is the expectation of the indicator-truncated
random variable `1_A X`. -/

/-- For a measurable event `A`, Equation (8.4) identifies the truncated expectation with the set
integral of `X` over `A`. -/
