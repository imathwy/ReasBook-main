-- Proof sketch: for `n > 0`, the first coordinate gives an injection `ℝ ↪ EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`,
-- so `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is uncountable; then apply the general classification theorem
-- `PolishSpace.measurableEquivOfNotCountable`.

`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, both equipped with their Borel sigma-algebras, are isomorphic. -/

-- Proof sketch: `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is a standard Borel space, and every measurable
-- subset of a standard Borel space is again standard Borel by `MeasurableSet.standardBorel`.
/- Exercise 8.3.8 (2): every Borel subset of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is a Borel space in the
textbook sense, via the owner theorem `MeasurableSet.standardBorel` for measurable subsets of
standard Borel spaces. -/
