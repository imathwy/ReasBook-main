/-- Example 17.6: a convolution semigroup on `ℝ^d` yields, for every starting point `x`, a
continuous-time path law on `(ℝ^d)^[0,∞)` whose coordinate process starts at `x` and has the
stationary independent increment laws prescribed by the semigroup. This packages the Chapter 14
construction pointwise in the initial state. -/
