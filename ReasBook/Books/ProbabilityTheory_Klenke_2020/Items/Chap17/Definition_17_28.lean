/- Layering for Definition 17.28:
- `hittingAfter` is the core/canonical owner abstraction for first hitting times of a process into
  a subset.
- The textbook entrance time `τ_x^1` is the singleton specialization `hittingAfter X {x} 1`.
- The recursively defined family `iteratedEntranceTime` and the probability `everHitsProbability`
  remain source-facing declarations built on that owner abstraction, with `F[P, X] x y` as the
  textbook notation for the latter. -/

/- Canonical recall: the positive-time entrance time into a state is the singleton specialization
of `MeasureTheory.hittingAfter` started at time `1`. -/
recall MeasureTheory.hittingAfter

/-- The positive entrance-time family `k ↦ τ_x^k` of the path `X` into the state `x`. The first
entrance time `τ_x^1` is the singleton hitting time `hittingAfter X ({x} : Set E) 1`, and each
successor stage is the next visit to `x` after the previous entrance time. -/
