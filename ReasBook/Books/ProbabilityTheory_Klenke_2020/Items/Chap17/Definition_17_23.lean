/-- Definition 17.23: a matrix `q` on the state space `E` is a Q-matrix if each off-diagonal
entry is nonnegative and every row has total sum `0`. The diagonal entries are then automatically
nonpositive. This is the infinitesimal generator of the transition semigroup of the continuous-time
Markov process.
