/- Layering for Definition 17.33:
- `totalVisitsFrom` is the primitive pathwise visit-count observable from time `N` onward.
- `greenFunctionFrom` is the owner abstraction for the expected visit count from time `N` onward.
- `totalVisits` and `greenFunction` are the `N = 0` source-facing specializations.
- Later positive-time variants should reuse `greenFunctionFrom P X 1` rather than introducing
  parallel Green-function owners. -/
