/- Exercise 17.5.5 is `source-facing`: it recalls from Theorem 17.41 the special function
`modifiedBesselI0`, its defining series, and the owner-level Green-function formula `(17.25)` for
the canonical symmetric simple random walk. The translation-invariant step-matrix theorem is only
a `bridge/view` companion there and is not the main public entry for this exercise. -/
