Lemma 14.18 (measurability): for nonnegative measurable functions on `Fin n → ℝ`, the
convolution with respect to Lebesgue measure is measurable. This is exactly the canonical owner
theorem `MeasureTheory.measurable_lconvolution`, specialized in the textbook to `μ = volume`.

Lemma 14.18 (commutativity for functions): on `Fin n → ℝ`, additive convolution of nonnegative
