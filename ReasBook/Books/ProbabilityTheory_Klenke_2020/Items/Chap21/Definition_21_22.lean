/-- Definition 21.22: A filtration on `ℝ≥0` satisfies the usual conditions if it is right
continuous in the canonical mathlib sense `Filtration.IsRightContinuous` and if every `μ`-null
set is already measurable in the initial `σ`-algebra `ℱ 0`. -/

/-- Helper for Definition 21.22: `UsualConditions` induces completeness of the initial trimmed
measure because every set of trimmed measure zero is ambient `μ`-null, hence already measurable in
`ℱ 0`. -/
