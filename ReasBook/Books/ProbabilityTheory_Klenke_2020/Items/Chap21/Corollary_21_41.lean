-- Proof sketch: apply the preceding tightness criterion on `C([0, ∞))`. The bounds needed there
-- for the family `X i + Y i` follow from the triangle inequality, both for uniform suprema on
-- compact time intervals and for the modulus-of-continuity terms.
/-- Corollary 21.41: if the laws of two families of continuous real-valued random variables on
`[0, ∞)` are tight, then the laws of their pointwise sums are tight. -/
