/- Definition 1.93: A simple real-valued function on a measurable space is the canonical mathlib
object `MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc Ω ℝ`, i.e. a bundled measurable function with finite range. The
textbook representation as a finite sum of constants times indicators of pairwise disjoint
measurable sets is recorded in the companion theorems below. -/

variable {Ω : Type u} [MeasurableSpace Ω]

-- Proof sketch: `SimpleFunc Ω ℝ` is by definition a measurable function with finite range, so the
-- forward implication uses `SimpleFunc.measurable` and `SimpleFunc.finite_range`, while the
-- reverse implication packages `f` with the measurable singleton fibers coming from `hf`.
/-- A real-valued map is the underlying function of a simple function exactly when it is
measurable and has finite range. -/

-- Proof sketch: the indicator-sum presentation is the textbook form of simple functions; combine
-- the canonical characterization above with an induction on simple functions using
-- `SimpleFunc.induction'`. Constants give a one-set decomposition, and the piecewise step refines
-- a disjoint measurable partition by intersection with a measurable set and its complement.
