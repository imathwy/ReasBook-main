canonical filter `liminf` along `atTop`; for a sequence this is the union of the tail
intersections. -/

/-- Definition 1.13 (2): the set-theoretic limes superior of a sequence of subsets of `Ω` is the
canonical filter `limsup` along `atTop`; for a sequence this is the intersection of the tail

point. -/
