-- Proof sketch: if the source measurable space is `⊤`, apply `measurable_from_top`; if the
-- target measurable space is `⊥`, only the measurable sets `∅` and `univ` in the codomain need to
-- be checked.
/-- Example 1.77 (2): If the source measurable space is discrete or the target measurable space is
trivial, then every map is measurable. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply `measurable_indicator_const_iff` with the nonzero value `1 : Fin 2`; the
-- type `Fin 2` carries the discrete measurable structure corresponding to the full sigma-algebra
-- on a two-point space.
/-- Example 1.77 (3): The indicator of a set, valued in the discrete two-point space `Fin 2`, is
measurable if and only if the set itself is measurable. -/
