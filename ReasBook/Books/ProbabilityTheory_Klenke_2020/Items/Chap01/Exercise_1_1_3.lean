-- Proof sketch: The set `{x | ContinuousAt f x}` is a `Gδ` set in a metrizable domain with
-- pseudometrizable codomain, hence it is Borel measurable by
-- `measurableSet_of_continuousAt`. The discontinuity set is its complement.
/-- Exercise 1.1.3: For a map between metric spaces, the set of points at which the map is
discontinuous is a Borel subset of the domain. -/
