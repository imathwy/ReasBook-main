-- Proof sketch: transport a nonmeasurable subset of `ℝ¹` from Remark 1.22 to a subset of `ℝ`,
-- take its indicator with value `1`, compare it almost everywhere to the measurable zero
-- function for the zero measure, and use the nonmeasurability of the underlying set.
/-- Exercise 1.4.2: in general measure spaces, almost-everywhere equality with a measurable
function does not force measurability; concretely, there exist a measure `μ` on `ℝ`, a
measurable function `f`, and a nonmeasurable function `g` such that `g = f` `μ`-almost
everywhere. -/
