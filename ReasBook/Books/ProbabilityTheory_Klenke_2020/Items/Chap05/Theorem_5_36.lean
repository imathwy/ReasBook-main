-- Proof sketch: `rawRenewalCountingProcess W` is the textbook `sInf` renewal count. The canonical
-- `renewalCountingProcess W` agrees with it on the almost-sure genuine renewal paths singled out
-- by the exponential interarrival hypotheses, and the chapter's `IsPoissonProcess` owner is then
-- applied to that canonical representative. The auxiliary a.e. arrival-time lemmas keep the
-- source-facing assumptions at the i.i.d. exponential layer; independent increments still come
-- from disjoint blocks of the i.i.d. interarrival sequence, the single-coordinate exponential law
-- propagates to every coordinate via `IsIID`, and Theorem 5.35 identifies each increment over
-- `[s,t]` with a Poisson law of parameter `α * (t - s)`.
-- Semantic recall: no direct mathlib renewal-process owner surfaced, so the local
-- `IsPoissonProcess` API is used only for the chapter's canonical representative of the textbook
-- count.

surely with the raw textbook `sInf` count under the i.i.d. exponential hypotheses. -/
