/- Theorem 5.6 (1): (i) The textbook identity
`Var[X; μ] = μ[fun ω ↦ (X ω - μ[X]) ^ 2]` is the canonical theorem
`variance_eq_integral`, which holds under the weaker assumption `AEMeasurable X μ`. -/
recall variance_eq_integral

/- Theorem 5.6 (2): (i) The variance is nonnegative; this is the canonical theorem
`variance_nonneg`, again with no square-integrability hypothesis needed. -/
recall variance_nonneg

-- Proof sketch: the forward implication is `ProbabilityTheory.ae_eq_integral_of_variance_eq_zero`;
-- the converse follows by substituting the almost-sure constancy into the variance integral.
/-- Theorem 5.6 (3): (ii) A square-integrable real random variable has variance zero exactly when it
is almost surely equal to its expectation. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply the canonical inequality
-- `ProbabilityTheory.variance_le_expectation_sq` to the shifted variable `ω ↦ X ω - x`, then
-- rewrite its variance back to `Var[X; μ]` via `ProbabilityTheory.variance_sub_const`.
/-- Theorem 5.6 (4): (iii) Among all constants `x : ℝ`, the expected squared distance from `X` to
`x` is minimized at the expectation `μ[X]`; together with Theorem 5.6 (1), this gives the minimum
value `Var[X; μ]`. -/
