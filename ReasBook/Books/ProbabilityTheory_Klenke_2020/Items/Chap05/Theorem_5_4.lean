/- Theorem 5.4: if `X` and `Y` are independent integrable real random variables on a probability
space, then the product `XY` is integrable. This is the canonical theorem
`IndepFun.integrable_mul`. -/
recall IndepFun.integrable_mul

variable {μ : Measure Ω} {X Y : Ω → ℝ}

-- Proof sketch: apply the canonical factorization theorem
-- `IndepFun.integral_mul_eq_mul_integral`; the required strong measurability follows from the
-- integrability hypotheses.
/-- Theorem 5.4: if `X` and `Y` are independent integrable real random variables on a probability
space, then their expectation factors as `𝔼[XY] = 𝔼[X] 𝔼[Y]`. -/

-- Proof sketch: `IndepFun.covariance_eq_zero` is the canonical covariance formulation, and
-- `Definition_5_1` packages uncorrelatedness as square-integrability together with vanishing
-- covariance.
/-- Theorem 5.4: in particular, independent square-integrable real random variables are
uncorrelated. -/
