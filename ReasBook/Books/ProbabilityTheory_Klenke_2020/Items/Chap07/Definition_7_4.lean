/- Definition 7.4: A convex subset of a vector space is the canonical mathlib predicate
`Convex 𝕜 G` on a set `G`, expressing closure under convex combinations of two points of `G`.
This is the owner abstraction used throughout mathlib for convexity. -/

/- The textbook coefficient formulation of convexity is the standard characterization
`convex_iff_add_mem`: if `x, y ∈ G` and `a, b ≥ 0` with `a + b = 1`, then
`a • x + b • y ∈ G`. Specializing to `a = λ` and `b = 1 - λ` recovers the
usual `λ x + (1 - λ) y` condition for `λ ∈ [0,1]`. -/
