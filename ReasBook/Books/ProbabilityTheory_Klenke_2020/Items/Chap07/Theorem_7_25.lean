-- Proof sketch: a closed subspace of a complete inner product space has an orthogonal projection.
-- The canonical decomposition is therefore given by the projections onto `W` and `Wᗮ`, and the
-- textbook `∃!` formulation is the corresponding uniqueness corollary.
/- Theorem 7.25: the canonical orthogonal decomposition is already the owner theorem
`Submodule.starProjection_add_starProjection_orthogonal`, specialized in this chapter to closed
subspaces of complete real inner product spaces. -/

/-- Theorem 7.25: Every vector in a Hilbert space has a unique decomposition into a vector in a
closed subspace and a vector in its orthogonal complement. This is the textbook existence-and-
uniqueness form of the canonical decomposition above. -/
