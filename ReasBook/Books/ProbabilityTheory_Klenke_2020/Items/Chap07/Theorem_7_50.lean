-- Proof sketch: injectivity follows from `lpDualityMap_isometry`. For surjectivity, represent a
-- continuous linear functional on `L^p(μ)` by the signed measure `ν(A) = F(1_A)`, apply the
-- Radon-Nikodym theorem to obtain a density `f`, prove `f ∈ L^{p'}(μ)` by the usual `p = 1` and
-- `1 < p < ∞` cases, and then identify the resulting integral functional with `F` on a dense
-- class of simple functions.
/-- Theorem 7.50: under the ambient sigma-finite hypothesis on `μ`, if `1 ≤ p < ∞` and `q`
satisfies `1 / p + 1 / q = 1`, then the canonical map `κ : L^q(μ) → (L^p(μ))'` is bijective.
Here `q` is represented by `ENNReal.conjExponent p`. -/
