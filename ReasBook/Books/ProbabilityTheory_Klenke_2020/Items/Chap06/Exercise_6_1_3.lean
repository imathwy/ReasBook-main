/-- Exercise 6.1.3: a source-facing complement-set reformulation of
`MeasureTheory.tendstoUniformlyOn_of_ae_tendsto'` for real-valued measurable functions on a finite
measure space. It produces a measurable set on which the convergence is uniform and whose
complement has arbitrarily small measure. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply mathlib's finite-measure Egorov theorem to the sequence `fSeq` and limit
-- `f`, using measurable-to-strongly-measurable for real-valued functions. Run the theorem with
-- tolerance `ε / 2`, then replace the exceptional set `t` by `A := tᶜ` so that
-- `μ (Aᶜ) = μ t < ε`.
