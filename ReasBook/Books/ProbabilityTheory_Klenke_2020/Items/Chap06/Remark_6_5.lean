-- Proof sketch: on each finite-measure set `s`, apply the canonical finite-measure
-- uniqueness theorem `tendstoInMeasure_ae_unique` to the restricted measure `μ.restrict s`. The
-- canonical sigma-finite globalization theorem `ae_of_forall_measure_lt_top_ae_restrict` then
-- promotes these restricted almost-everywhere equalities to `f = g` almost everywhere on `Ω`.
/-- Remark 6.5: Let `β` be a metric space. On a `σ`-finite measure space, if a sequence converges
in `μ`-measure on every set of finite `μ`-measure to both `f` and `g`, then `f` and
`g` are equal `μ`-almost everywhere. Equivalently, in a separated metric codomain, local
convergence in measure `TendstoInMeasureOnFiniteMeasureSets` determines the limit up to a.e.
equality. -/
