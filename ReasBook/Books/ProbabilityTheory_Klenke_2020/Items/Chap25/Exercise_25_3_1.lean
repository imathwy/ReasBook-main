/-- Helper for Exercise 25.3.1: every continuous path of locally bounded variation has zero dyadic
square variation. This is the deterministic bounded-variation input behind the exchange identities
in the textbook exercise. -/

  -- Proof comment: the required square-variation owner is exactly the Chapter 21 zero-variation
  -- criterion for continuous paths of locally bounded variation.
