def weissFreeEnergy (β h m : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  weissMeanFieldEnergy h m - β⁻¹ * weissEntropy m

-- Proof sketch: unfold `weissFreeEnergy`, `weissMeanFieldEnergy`, and `weissEntropy`, then
-- simplify the signs in the entropy contribution.
/-- The Weiss free energy is the mean-field energy plus the inverse-temperature weighted entropy
term written in logarithmic form. -/

-- Proof sketch: the stationary-point equation is `-m - h + β⁻¹ * Real.artanh m = 0`. Multiply by
-- `β`, rewrite it as `Real.artanh m = β * (m + h)`, then apply `Real.tanh` and use
-- `Real.tanh_artanh hm`; the converse uses `Real.artanh_tanh`.
/-- Example 23.20: for `m ∈ (-1,1)` and positive inverse temperature `β`, the stationary-point
equation for the Weiss free energy is equivalent to the mean-field fixed-point equation
`m = tanh (β (m + h))`. -/
