/- Theorem 15.2: the Stone--Weierstrass theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces over `ℝ` or `ℂ` is
the canonical mathlib theorem
`ContinuousMap.starSubalgebra_topologicalClosure_eq_top_of_separatesPoints`, formulated for star
subalgebras of `C(E, 𝕜)`; in the real case the star condition is automatic, and in the complex case
it is exactly closure under complex conjugation. -/
