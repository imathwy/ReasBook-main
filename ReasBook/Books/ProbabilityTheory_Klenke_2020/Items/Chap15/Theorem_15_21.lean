their characteristic functions is uniformly equicontinuous on `ℝ^d`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use tightness to choose a common compact cube carrying almost all mass for every
-- `μ ∈ ℱ`; on that compact set the oscillatory kernel `x ↦ exp (⟪x, t⟫ * I)` varies uniformly in
-- `t`, which gives a uniform bound on `|1 - charFun μ (t - s)|`; then combine this with the
-- translation identity from the preceding lemma to deduce a common modulus of continuity.
