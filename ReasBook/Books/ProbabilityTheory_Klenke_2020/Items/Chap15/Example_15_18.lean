-- Proof sketch: use the canonical owner `φΔ = charFun (triangularCharacteristicMeasure (π / 2))`.
-- If `t ∈ IΔ`, use `hψ_eq`; if `t ∉ IΔ`, the owner characteristic function vanishes,
-- since `charFun_triangularCharacteristicMeasure` specializes to the tent function there.
/-- If a characteristic function agrees on `[-π / 2, π / 2]` with the triangular characteristic
function from Example 15.15 at `a = π / 2`, then their products with that characteristic function
agree everywhere. -/

-- Proof sketch: use independence to identify the characteristic functions of `X + Y` and `X + Z`
-- for the measurable random variables `X`, `Y`, and `Z` with the products `φ_X φ_Y` and
-- `φ_X φ_Z`. Rewrite these using the hypotheses
-- `φ_X = φ_Y = φΔ` and `φ_Z = ψ`, apply
-- `example1518TriangularCharFun_mul_eq_of_agreesOn`, and then use uniqueness of characteristic
-- functions for probability measures. If `Y` and `Z` were identically distributed, then their
-- pushforward
-- laws would have the same characteristic function, contradicting `hψ_ne`.
/-- Example 15.18: if `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are independent measurable real random variables with
`φ_X = φ_Y = charFun (triangularCharacteristicMeasure (π / 2))`, with `φ_Z = ψ`, and if `ψ`
agrees with this characteristic function on `[-π / 2, π / 2]` but is not equal to it, then
`X + Y` and `X + Z` are identically distributed although `Y` and `Z` are not. -/
