/- Layering for Definition 19.8:
- `source-facing`: the singleton detailed-balance equation for `p` with respect to a measure `π`,
  and the plain notion that such a `π` exists.
- `core/canonical`: mathlib's owner `Kernel.IsReversible (discreteMatrixKernel p) π`.
- `bridge/view`: `SatisfiesDetailedBalance p π` is the raw singleton equation and
  `IsReversibleWithRespectTo p π` is a thin alias for that equation.
  The source definition does not identify this with the setwise owner on arbitrary discrete
  spaces, so no owner-level equivalence is part of the main item surface here.
  Countable or atomic hypotheses needed to upgrade singleton balance to setwise reversibility
  belong in later companion results, not in Definition 19.8 itself. -/
-- Semantic recall note: `lean_leansearch` points to the canonical owner
-- `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.IsReversible`; local chapter files upgrade singleton detailed
-- balance to that setwise notion only under extra countability hypotheses, so this definition
-- stays at the source-faithful pointwise level.
