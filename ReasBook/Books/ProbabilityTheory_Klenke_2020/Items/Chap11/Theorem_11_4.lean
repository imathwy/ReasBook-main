/- Theorem 11.4 is `source-facing`: its hypothesis is the textbook boundedness of the positive
parts. The `core/canonical` owner layer is the `Submartingale` API for `ℱ.limitProcess`. The only
local `bridge/view` needed here is the passage from bounded positive-part expectations to the
owner hypothesis `∀ n, eLpNorm (X n) 1 μ ≤ R`. -/

-- Proof sketch: bounded positive-part expectations and monotonicity of submartingale expectations
-- give a uniform `L¹` bound on `X`, which is exactly the owner input for the canonical
-- `limitProcess` convergence and integrability theorems.

/- The canonical limit process of an `L¹`-bounded submartingale is measurable with respect to the
terminal σ-algebra `⨆ n, ℱ n`; the project uses the stronger owner declaration asserting
`StronglyMeasurable[⨆ n, ℱ n]`. -/
