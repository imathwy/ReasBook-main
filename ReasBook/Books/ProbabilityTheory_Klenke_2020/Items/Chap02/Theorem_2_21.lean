-- Proof sketch: the forward implication is the specialization of
-- `iIndepFun_iff_measure_inter_preimage_eq_mul` to the measurable lower intervals `Iic (x j)`.
-- For the converse, the rational lower intervals form a π-system generating `borel ℝ`, so the
-- π-system extension theorem upgrades independence of these lower-orthant preimages to
-- independence of the real-valued family.
/-- Theorem 2.21: A family of real random variables is independent if and only if, for every
finite `J ⊆ I` and every `x ∈ ℝ^J`, the finite-dimensional distribution function on the lower
orthant `∏ j ∈ J, (-∞, x_j]` factors as the product of the one-dimensional marginal distribution
functions, i.e. equation (2.8). -/
