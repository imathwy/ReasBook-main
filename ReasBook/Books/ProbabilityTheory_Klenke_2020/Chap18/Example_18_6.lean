/-- Example 18.6: the independent coalescent transition matrix on `E × E`; away from the diagonal
the two coordinates evolve independently with transition matrix `p`, and once the two coordinates
meet they move together along the diagonal. -/
def independentCoalescentMatrix (p : E → E → ℝ≥0∞) : (E × E) → (E × E) → ℝ≥0∞
  | (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂) =>
      if x₁ = y₁ then
        if x₂ = y₂ then p x₁ x₂ else 0
      else
        p x₁ x₂ * p y₁ y₂

-- Proof sketch: unfold `independentCoalescentMatrix`; when the starting coordinates are distinct,
-- the definition immediately reduces to the product of the two one-step transition probabilities.
/-- Off the diagonal, the independent coalescent uses the product transition law of two
independent copies of the chain with transition matrix `p`. -/
theorem independentCoalescentMatrix_apply_of_ne
    (p : E → E → ℝ≥0∞) {x₁ y₁ x₂ y₂ : E} (h : x₁ ≠ y₁) :

  -- The off-diagonal hypothesis selects the independent-product branch of the definition.
  simp [independentCoalescentMatrix, h]

-- Proof sketch: unfold `independentCoalescentMatrix`; on the diagonal the outer `if` uses
-- `x = x`, and the inner `if` reduces the diagonal-to-diagonal transition to `p x z`.
/-- Once the two coordinates have coalesced at `x`, a diagonal transition to `(z, z)` has
probability `p x z`. -/
theorem independentCoalescentMatrix_apply_diag
    (p : E → E → ℝ≥0∞) (x z : E) :
    independentCoalescentMatrix p (x, x) (z, z) = p x z := by
  -- On the diagonal, both `if` tests reduce to equality and the entry becomes `p x z`.
  simp [independentCoalescentMatrix]

-- Proof sketch: unfold `independentCoalescentMatrix`; on the diagonal the inner `if` forces every
-- transition to a non-diagonal state to have probability `0`.
/-- Once the two coordinates have coalesced, the independent coalescent cannot leave the diagonal.
-/
theorem independentCoalescentMatrix_apply_diag_of_ne

  -- A diagonal state can only transition to another diagonal state.
  simp [independentCoalescentMatrix, h]

-- Proof sketch: split the row indexed by `(x, y)` into the off-diagonal case `x ≠ y`, where the
-- row sum factors as the product of two stochastic row sums, and the diagonal case `x = y`, where
-- only the diagonal states `(z, z)` contribute and the row sum is the single stochastic row sum
-- of `p`.
/-- The independent coalescent matrix is stochastic whenever `p` is stochastic. -/
