/- Lemma 8.10 (1): For an integrable real random variable `X`, the conditional expectation
`P[X | ℱ]` is `ℱ`-strongly measurable. This is the canonical mathlib form of the textbook
measurability statement. -/

variable {ℱ : MeasurableSpace Ω} {X : Ω → ℝ}

/- The textbook `ℱ`-measurability statement is the direct corollary
`MeasureTheory.stronglyMeasurable_condExp.measurable`. -/
#check (stronglyMeasurable_condExp.measurable : Measurable[ℱ] (P[X | ℱ]))

/- Lemma 8.10 (2): For an integrable real random variable `X`, the conditional expectation
`P[X | ℱ]` lies in `ℒ¹(P)`. Mathlib states the stronger fact without any extra integrability
assumption on `X`, since `P[X | ℱ]` is defined to be `0` outside the usual domain. -/

/- Lemma 8.10 (3): If `A ∈ ℱ`, then the conditional expectation has the same integral as `X`
over `A`. -/
