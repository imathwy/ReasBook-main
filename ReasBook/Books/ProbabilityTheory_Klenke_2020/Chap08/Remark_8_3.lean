-- Proof sketch: if `P B = 0`, then `P (B ∩ A) = 0` by `measure_inter_null_of_null_left`, while
-- `c * P B = c * 0 = 0`. So the defining equation from Definition 8.2 is automatically satisfied
-- for every `c`.
/-- Remark 8.3: if the conditioning event `B` has probability `0`, then every
chosen value `c` satisfies the defining equation `c * P B = P (B ∩ A)`. Thus Definition 8.2 does
not determine a unique conditional-probability value on null conditioning events. -/

-- Proof sketch: `ProbabilityTheory.cond_eq_zero_of_meas_eq_zero` identifies the conditioned
-- measure `P[|B]` with `0` when `P B = 0`. Evaluating that measure at `A` gives `P[A | B] = 0`.
/-- Auxiliary canonical consequence of Remark 8.3: when `P B = 0`, the conditioned measure `P[|B]`
is `0`, so the canonical conditional probability `P[A | B]` evaluates to `0`. -/
