local notation "Ξₙ" => fun n ω ↦ empiricalDistribution (Nat.succPNat n) (fun i ↦ X i) ω

-- Proof sketch: the intended route is the conditional strong law from the directing random
-- probability measure in Theorem 12.26, rewritten through the empirical-distribution integral.
/-- Remark 12.27 (1): if `Ξ∞` is a directing random probability measure for `X` as in Theorem 12.26,
then the empirical distributions of the prefixes `X₀, ..., Xₙ` converge almost surely against
every bounded continuous test function to `Ξ∞`. The zero-based sequence
`n ↦ empiricalDistribution (Nat.succPNat n) (fun i ↦ X i)` is the Lean encoding of the textbook
empirical measures `Ξₙ`. This records the source-facing bounded-continuous test-function
formulation from part (i). -/

-- Proof sketch: once part (i) is upgraded to weak convergence on a full-measure set, local
-- compactness of `E` yields almost-sure convergence of the empirical laws themselves.
/-- Remark 12.27 (2): if, in addition to the standing assumptions from Theorem 12.26, the state
space `E` is locally compact, then the empirical laws `Ξₙ` themselves converge almost surely to
the directing random probability measure `Ξ∞`. This is the source's locally-compact upgrade of the
bounded-continuous test-function convergence recorded above, expressed on the canonical owner
surface `ProbabilityMeasure E`. -/

/- The textbook's part (ii), concerning finite exchangeable families, is bibliographic prose
rather than a mathematical statement and is therefore not encoded as a Lean declaration here. -/
