-- Proof sketch: For the forward direction, use `IsSetAlgebra.univ_mem`, `IsSetAlgebra.compl_mem`,
-- and `IsSetAlgebra.inter_mem`. For the reverse direction, obtain `∅ ∈ A` from `univ ∈ A` and
-- complement closure, then recover closure under binary unions from complements and intersections
-- by De Morgan's law.
