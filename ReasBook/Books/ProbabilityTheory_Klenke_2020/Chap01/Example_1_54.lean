-- Proof sketch: apply the countable subadditivity of the canonical volume measure on `Fin n → ℝ`
-- to the countable cover by half-open rectangles; Example 1.39 identifies this measure with the
-- textbook rectangle volume.
/-- Example 1.54: If a half-open rectangle in `ℝ^n` is covered by countably many half-open
rectangles, then the canonical volume of the first rectangle is bounded above by the sum of the
volumes of the covering rectangles. This is the `σ`-subadditivity check used for extending the
rectangle volume to Borel sets. -/
