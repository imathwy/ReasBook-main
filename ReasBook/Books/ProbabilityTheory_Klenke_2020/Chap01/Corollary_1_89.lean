/-- Corollary 1.89 (5): if `X : Ω → EReal` is measurable, then its positive part `X⁺`,
formalized as `max X 0`, is measurable. -/
-- Proof sketch: `x ↦ max x 0` is measurable on `EReal`, so its composition with `X` is measurable.

/-- Corollary 1.89 (6): if `X : Ω → EReal` is measurable, then its negative part `X⁻`,
formalized as `max (-X) 0`, is measurable. -/
-- Proof sketch: measurability follows from measurability of negation,
-- `max`, and the constant map `0`.
