-- Proof sketch: for the forward implication, apply
-- `Measurable.exists_eq_measurable_comp` to the map `g` viewed as measurable on the pullback
-- measurable space `mΩ'.comap f`. For the converse, compose the measurable factor `φ` with the
-- pullback-measurable map `f` using `Measurable.comp`.
/-- Corollary 1.97: A map `g : Ω → EReal` is `σ(f)`-measurable, meaning measurable for the
pullback `σ`-algebra `mΩ'.comap f`, if and only if there is a measurable map `φ : Ω' → EReal`
such that `g = φ ∘ f`. -/
