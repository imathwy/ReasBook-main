/- Definition 1.20: A topology on a set `Ω` is the canonical mathlib notion
`TopologicalSpace Ω`; its open sets are the sets `s` with `IsOpen s`, and a set is closed exactly
when its complement is open. -/

variable {Ω : Type u} [PseudoMetricSpace Ω] {s : Set Ω}

/- In a metric space, and more generally in a pseudometric space, the canonical local openness
criterion is `Metric.isOpen_iff`: a set is open iff every point of the set lies in some positive
radius open ball contained in the set. -/
recall Metric.isOpen_iff

/-- Textbook reformulation of `Metric.isOpen_iff`: open sets are exactly unions of open balls with
positive radius. -/
