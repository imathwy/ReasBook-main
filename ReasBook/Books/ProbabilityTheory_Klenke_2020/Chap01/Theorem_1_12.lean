-- Proof sketch: `MeasurableSpace.DynkinSystem.ofMeasurableSpace` is the canonical lambda-system
-- attached to a measurable space, and its predicate of members is definitionally the measurable
-- sets of `m`.

lambda-system. -/

-- Proof sketch: the measurable sets are closed under `∅`, complements, and binary unions, so they
-- satisfy the fields of `MeasureTheory.IsSetAlgebra`.

-- Proof sketch: measurable sets contain `∅`, are closed under set difference via complement and
-- intersection, and are closed under countable unions by the `MeasurableSpace` axioms.

-- Proof sketch: this is the forgetful implication from the extra countable-union closure in a
-- sigma-ring to the underlying ring-of-sets structure.

  exact hA.toIsSetRing

-- Proof sketch: for a ring of sets, intersections are obtained from differences, and then the
-- semiring decomposition of a difference is the singleton finite partition `{s \\ t}`.

algebra of sets already reduces to a finite union. -/
