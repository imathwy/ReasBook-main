/-- Exercise 1.5.2: there exists a probability measure on `ℝ × Bool` for which the first
coordinate and the signed first coordinate are both Gaussian random variables, but their pair is
not a two-dimensional Gaussian random variable. -/
-- Proof sketch: take a standard Gaussian variable `Z` together with an independent Rademacher
-- sign `ε`, and set `X = Z` and `Y = εZ`. Then `Y` is again Gaussian, while `(X, Y)` is supported
-- on the two lines `y = x` and `y = -x`, so its joint law is not Gaussian.
