-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

-- Proof sketch: relative measurability with respect to `σ(|·|)` means that `g` factors through
-- `abs`; applying the resulting `FactorsThrough` statement to `x` and `-x` gives evenness.
-- Conversely, an even measurable map satisfies `g ∘ abs = g`, so it is measurable with respect to
-- `MeasurableSpace.comap abs (borel ℝ)` by composing with `comap_measurable abs`.
/-- Exercise 1.4.1: For a Borel measurable map `g : ℝ → ℝ`, measurability with respect to the
σ-algebra `σ(|·|) = MeasurableSpace.comap abs (borel ℝ)` is equivalent to `g` being even. -/
