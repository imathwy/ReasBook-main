-- Proof sketch: view `E^ℕ` with the product topology of the discrete finite space `E`; the
-- initial cylinders are clopen and hence compact. A countable open cover of a compact cylinder
-- therefore has a finite subcover.
/-- Example 1.63: If a cylinder set in `E^ℕ` is covered by countably many cylinder sets and `E` is
finite, then finitely many members of the cover already cover it. This is the compactness statement
used to verify (1.13) in the construction of the infinite product content. -/
