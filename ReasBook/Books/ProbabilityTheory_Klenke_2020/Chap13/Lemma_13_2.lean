/-- Lemma 13.2: for a subset of a complete metric space realizing the Polish topology, total
boundedness with respect to the metric is equivalent to relative compactness, formalized as
compactness of the closure. -/
-- Proof sketch: If `A` is totally bounded, then `closure A` is again totally bounded; since it is
-- closed in a complete metric space, it is compact. Conversely, a compact closure is totally
-- bounded, and every subset of a totally bounded set is totally bounded.
