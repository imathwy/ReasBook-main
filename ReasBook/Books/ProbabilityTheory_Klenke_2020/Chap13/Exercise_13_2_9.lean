-- Proof sketch: apply the null-boundary convergence hypothesis to `univ` to get convergence of the
-- total masses. For a closed set `F`, approximate `F` from outside by the closed `r`-neighborhoods
-- and choose radii whose boundaries are `μ`-null; then pass to the limit and let `r ↓ 0`.
/-- Exercise 13.2.9: the null-boundary setwise convergence condition in Theorem 13.16 directly
implies the closed-set Portmanteau condition. -/
