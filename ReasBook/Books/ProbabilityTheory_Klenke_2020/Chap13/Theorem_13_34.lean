-- Proof sketch: weak convergence implies tightness by Prohorov's theorem and gives convergence of
-- the integrals of every bounded continuous test function, hence of any separating subfamily. For
-- the converse, combine tightness with relative sequential compactness, pass to weakly convergent
-- subsequences, and use the separating family to identify every subsequential limit with `μ`.
/-- Theorem 13.34: for subprobability finite measures on a Polish space, weak convergence to `μ`
is equivalent to tightness of the sequence together with convergence of the integrals on some
separating family of bounded continuous real-valued test functions. -/
