/- Layer triage for Exercise 13.3.1.
- `source-facing`: existence of a measurable coercive weight with uniformly bounded integrals.
- `core/canonical`: `MeasureTheory.IsTightMeasureSet`.
- `bridge/view`: `tight_family_iff_forall_exists_isCompact_measure_compl_lt` is the chapter's
  compact-control reformulation of the same owner predicate for finite-measure families.
-/

-- Proof sketch: for the forward implication, extract compact sets with uniformly small complement
-- mass and assemble from them a measurable coercive weight by summing suitably scaled indicators of
-- those compacts. For the reverse implication, use Markov-type estimates on the sublevel sets of
-- the coercive weight to obtain compact sets whose complement mass is uniformly small over the
-- family.

This is a source-facing bridge theorem over the canonical owner abstraction
`MeasureTheory.IsTightMeasureSet`, specialized to families of finite measures on `ℝ`.
