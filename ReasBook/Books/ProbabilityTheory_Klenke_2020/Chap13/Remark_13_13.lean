-- Proof sketch: weak convergence is the canonical convergence `Tendsto` on `FiniteMeasure E`.
-- Uniqueness is therefore just the ambient Hausdorff uniqueness of limits in the weak topology on
-- `FiniteMeasure E`.
/-- Helper for Remark 13.13: weak convergence of finite measures determines the finite limit measure
uniquely. In particular, the textbook metric Borel statement is an immediate special case. -/

-- Proof sketch: use the source-facing owner predicate `radonMeasureVaguelyConvergesTo`. If the
-- same sequence converges vaguely to both `μ` and `ν`, then the compactly supported continuous
-- test integrals agree for both candidates, and Theorem 13.11 (2) separates Radon measures on a
-- locally compact metric space.
/-- Remark 13.13 (2): on a locally compact metric space, a sequence of Radon measures has at most
one vague limit, in the sense that convergence of all compactly supported continuous test
integrals determines the Radon limit measure uniquely. -/
