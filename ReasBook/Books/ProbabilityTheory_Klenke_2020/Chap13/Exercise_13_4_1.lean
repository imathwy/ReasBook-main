/- Layer triage for Exercise 13.4.1.
- `source-facing`: a tightness criterion for families of probability measures on
  `ProbabilityMeasure E`, phrased using small escape-mass events in the base space `E`.
- `core/canonical`: `IsTightMeasureSet` on measures over `ProbabilityMeasure E`.
- `bridge/view`: the chapter owner bridge
  `FiniteMeasure.tight_family_iff_forall_exists_isCompact_measure_compl_lt`, applied on the
  ambient space `ProbabilityMeasure E`, together with the canonical Prokhorov compactness API for
  compact families of probability measures on `E`.
-/

-- Proof sketch: first use the owner bridge
-- `FiniteMeasure.tight_family_iff_forall_exists_isCompact_measure_compl_lt` on the ambient space
-- `ProbabilityMeasure E` to reduce meta-tightness to compact control by subsets of
-- `ProbabilityMeasure E`. For the forward implication, apply this to a compact family of
-- probability measures on `E`, then use Prokhorov tightness on `E` to obtain one compact
-- `K ⊆ E` controlling the escape mass of every measure in the compact family. For the reverse
-- implication, choose compact sets in `E` for a summable sequence of tolerances, replace them by
-- finite unions to get a monotone compact sequence, and apply the Prokhorov compactness theorem
-- to the set of probability measures whose masses outside these compacts are uniformly small.
