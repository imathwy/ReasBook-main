noncomputable section

/- This exercise splits naturally across the chapter's two convergence layers.
- `source-facing`: vague convergence is stated with `radonMeasureVaguelyConvergesTo`.
- `core/canonical`: weak convergence is stated as `Tendsto ... (𝓝 μ)` on `FiniteMeasure ℝ`.
- `bridge/view`: the weak statement uses the owner embedding
  `ProbabilityMeasure.toFiniteMeasure`, while the canonical Dirac owner theorem is
  `tendsto_diracProba_iff_tendsto`.
The only primitive data here is the Dirac sequence `n ↦ δₙ`, so no extra local wrapper API is
introduced. -/

/-- First claim for the current exercise: the Dirac masses `δ_n` on `ℝ` converge vaguely to the zero
measure, in
the canonical sense of `radonMeasureVaguelyConvergesTo`. -/
-- Proof sketch: test against an arbitrary compactly supported continuous function `f`. Its support
-- is contained in some compact set, hence for all sufficiently large `n` one has `f n = 0`. Since
-- `∫ x, f x ∂Measure.dirac (n : ℝ) = f n`, the integrals are eventually zero and therefore tend to
-- the integral against the zero measure.

/-- Second claim for the current exercise: the Dirac masses `δ_n` on `ℝ`, viewed in the owner space
`FiniteMeasure ℝ`, do not converge weakly in its canonical weak topology. -/
-- Proof sketch: test weak convergence against the bounded continuous oscillating function
-- `x ↦ cos (π x)`. The current theorem header is real-indexed, so after obtaining convergence of
-- the real-indexed Dirac integrals we pass to the natural-number subsequence `n ↦ (n : ℝ)`. Along
-- that subsequence the test integrals equal `(-1)^n`, which cannot converge.
