-- Proof sketch: take a centered real law in the Gaussian domain of attraction with finite second

-- infinite product probability space, and then apply the one-dimensional central limit theorem to
-- the raw `√n`-normalized partial sums built from the chapter owner `partialSum`.
/- Exercise 15.5.1 is `source-facing`: it asks for an independent sequence of measurable real
random variables with infinite first absolute moments whose raw `√n`-normalized partial sums
converge in distribution. The project owner for the finite sums themselves is `partialSum`, so the
statement reuses that owner directly instead of introducing a parallel public wrapper for the same
construction. -/
/-- Exercise 15.5.1: there exists an independent sequence `X₁, X₂, ...` of real random variables
such that every absolute first moment is infinite, but the normalized sums
`(X₁ + ⋯ + X_n) / √n` converge in distribution to the standard Gaussian law. In Lean's `0`-based
indexing, these are the maps `ω ↦ (√n)⁻¹ * partialSum X n ω`. -/
