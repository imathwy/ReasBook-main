-- Proof sketch: write `n₂ = k n₁`, partition the `n₂` Bernoulli trials into `k` blocks of length
-- `n₁`, choose the block-success parameter so that the zero-count probability matches
-- `(1 - p₂) ^ n₂`, and couple the `n₁`-count with the number of nonempty blocks to obtain an
-- ordered coupling supported on `{(x₁, x₂) : ℕ × ℕ | x₁ ≤ x₂}`.
/-- Exercise 17.7.1: when `n₁ ∣ n₂`, the condition
`(1 - p₁) ^ n₁ ≥ (1 - p₂) ^ n₂` yields a direct coupling of the binomial laws
`Bin(n₁, p₁)` and `Bin(n₂, p₂)` that is supported on the order relation `x₁ ≤ x₂`, and hence
proves the divisible-case claim of Theorem 17.60. -/
