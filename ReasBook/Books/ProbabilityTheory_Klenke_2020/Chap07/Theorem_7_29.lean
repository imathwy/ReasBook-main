-- Proof sketch: use a σ-finite exhaustion `spanningSets ν n`; on each finite-measure piece,
-- restrict both density identities and apply the canonical finite-total-mass uniqueness theorem
-- `withDensity_eq_iff`, then assemble the resulting restricted almost-everywhere equalities.
/-- Theorem 7.29: if `ν` is σ-finite and `f₁`, `f₂` are measurable densities of `ν` with
respect to `μ`, then `f₁` and `f₂` agree `μ`-almost everywhere. In particular, the density
`dν/dμ` is unique up to `μ`-almost everywhere equality. -/
