/- Example 7.5 (1): A subset of `ℝ` is convex exactly when it is an interval, expressed in Lean
as order-connectedness. This is the canonical mathlib theorem
`convex_iff_ordConnected`; specializing it to `ℝ` gives the textbook statement. -/
recall convex_iff_ordConnected

/- Example 7.5 (2): Every linear subspace of a vector space is a convex subset of the ambient
space. This is exactly the canonical mathlib theorem `Submodule.convex`. -/
recall Submodule.convex

-- Proof sketch: if `μ` and `ν` both have total mass `1`, then any convex combination
-- `a • μ + b • ν` with `a + b = 1` again has total mass `1`.
/-- Example 7.5 (3): On a measurable space, the set of all probability measures is convex inside
the space of measures. -/
