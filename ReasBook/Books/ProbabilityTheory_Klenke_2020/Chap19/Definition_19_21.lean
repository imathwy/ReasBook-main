/- `source-facing`: Definition 19.21 is the owner declaration for the quadratic energy functional
of a finite electrical flow/current. Its primitive data are exactly a resistance function `R` and a
flow/current `I`; the double-sum formula is the definition itself, not a bridge to an earlier
owner. Definitions 19.13 and 19.14 provide the ambient flow/current notions, while
Theorem 19.20 is the bridge that rewrites boundary data into this same quadratic expression. Lean
uses the script notation `ℒ(I; R)` as a thin source-facing stand-in for the textbook symbol
`L_I^R`. -/
