/- Layering for Definition 19.23:
- `source-facing`: `escapeToSetProbability`, `escapeProbability`, the finite-boundary effective
  conductance formula `conductance C x₁ * escapeToSetProbability P X x₁ A₀`, and the effective
  conductance to infinity defined from those escape probabilities.
- `core/canonical`: the Chapter 19 conductance owner `conductance` from Definition 19.11 and the
  canonical positive-time ever-hit owner `F[P, X]`.
- `bridge/view`: the Chapter 19 escape probability lives in `ℝ≥0∞`, so its complement formula uses
  `ENNReal.ofReal ((F[P, X]) x₁ x₁)` while the theorem statements below still restate the source
  events in textbook coordinate form and connect them to the earlier owner predicate
  `IsRecurrentState`. -/

first positive-time return to `x₁`. -/
