/- Source repair note for Exercise 19.5.3:
- Fig. 19.15 is modeled here as the bi-infinite ladder graph on `ℤ × Fin 2`, with the marked
  vertices `a` and `z` the two endpoints of the rung over `0`.
- The finite seven-column helper from `Exercise_19_5_LadderGraphs` is a useful approximation, but
  it does not satisfy the source constants `√3` and `1 / √3`. The source-facing statement in this
  file therefore uses the bi-infinite figure directly. -/
