-- Proof sketch: use the supporting-functional argument at a boundary point of the effective domain
-- to produce a nonzero outward normal `u`, then show that every `v ∈ ∂ f x` generates the ray
-- `v + ℝ≥0 • u ⊆ ∂ f x`; hence a nonempty subdifferential cannot be bounded.
/-- Proposition 16.17 (1): clause (i). If the effective domain has nonempty interior and `x` lies
on its boundary, then the subdifferential at `x` is either empty or unbounded. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply the epigraph normal-cone characterization of Proposition 16.16 to a support
-- functional at the boundary point `(x, f x)` of `epi f`, obtaining a subgradient. Then combine
-- local boundedness of nearby subgradients with closedness and convexity of `∂ f x`, and conclude
-- weak compactness from the bounded closed convex criterion.
/-- Proposition 16.17 (2): clause (ii). At a continuity point of the finite-valued restriction of
`f` to its effective domain, the subdifferential is nonempty and weakly compact. -/

-- Proof sketch: continuity on the effective domain gives a neighborhood on which the finite-valued
-- restriction is Lipschitz. For `y` in a smaller ball and `v ∈ ∂ f y`, test the subgradient
-- inequality on short increments `z` to obtain a uniform norm bound on all nearby subgradients.
/-- Proposition 16.17 (3): clause (iii). At a continuity point of the finite-valued restriction of
`f` to its effective domain, there is a positive radius for which the union of the nearby
subdifferentials is bounded. -/

-- Proof sketch: Corollary 8.39 transports nonemptiness of the continuity set to continuity at
-- every interior-domain point, and clause (ii) then supplies a nonempty subdifferential at each of
-- those points.
/-- Proposition 16.17 (4): clause (iv). If the effective-domain continuity set is nonempty, then
every interior point of the effective domain is a subdifferentiability point. -/
