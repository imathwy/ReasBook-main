-- Proof sketch: one inclusion is immediate from the definition of fixed points. For the reverse
-- inclusion, choose a common fixed point `y`; quasinonexpansiveness gives
-- `‖(T₁ ∘ T₂) x - y‖ ≤ ‖T₂ x - y‖ ≤ ‖x - y‖`, and the equality `(T₁ ∘ T₂) x = x` forces equality
-- throughout. The strict quasinonexpansiveness of at least one factor then shows first that
-- `x ∈ fixedPointSetOn D T₂` or `T₂ x ∈ fixedPointSetOn D T₁`, and hence `x` is fixed by both
-- maps.

fixed point, and at least one of them is strictly quasinonexpansive, then the fixed points of the
composition `T₁ ∘ T₂` are exactly the common fixed points of `T₁` and `T₂` in `D`. -/
