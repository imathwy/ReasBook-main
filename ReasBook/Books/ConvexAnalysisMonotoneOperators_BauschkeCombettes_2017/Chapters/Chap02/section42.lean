  -- TODO: as written with real-valued `Filter.liminf`, this statement is false for general weakly
  -- convergent nets. In an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, weak neighborhoods of a nonzero
  -- point are unbounded, so one can build a weakly convergent net with no eventual norm upper
  -- bound. For such a net, mathlib's `Filter.liminf` on `ℝ` collapses to `0`, contradicting the
  -- desired inequality when `x ≠ 0`.
