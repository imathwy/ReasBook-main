/-- Example 2.27: an infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space admits a discontinuous real linear
functional. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose a countable orthonormal family and extend it to a Hamel basis; define the
-- linear functional by summing the coefficients along the orthonormal part. Partial sums built
-- from an `ℓ² \ ℓ¹` coefficient sequence converge in `H` while their images diverge, so the
-- functional is discontinuous; equivalently, its kernel is not closed.

/-- The closed-kernel criterion for linear forms recasts Example 2.27 in the equivalent form that
the kernel of a real linear functional need not be closed. -/
