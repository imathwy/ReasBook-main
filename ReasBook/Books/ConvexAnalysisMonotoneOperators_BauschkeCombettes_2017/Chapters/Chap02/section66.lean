/-- Fact 2.66: textbook open-neighborhood form of symmetry of the second Fréchet derivative.
If `T` admits a Fréchet derivative field `DT` on an open neighborhood `U` of `x`, and `DT` is
Fréchet differentiable at `x` with derivative `D2T`, then the bilinear map `(y, z) ↦ D2T y z`
is symmetric. -/
-- Proof sketch: because `U` is an open neighborhood of `x`, the hypotheses give a first
-- derivative field for `T` on some neighborhood of `x`; then apply
-- `second_derivative_symmetric_of_eventually_of_real` to the derivative field `DT`.
