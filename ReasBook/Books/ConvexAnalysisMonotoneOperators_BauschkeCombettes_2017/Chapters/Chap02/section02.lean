/- Example 2.2: in the Hilbert space `ℓ²(I, ℝ)`, the textbook standard unit vector at `i` is the
canonical element `lp.single 2 i 1`, i.e. the vector that is `1` at `i` and `0` elsewhere. -/
/- The canonical constructor for the textbook standard unit vector is `lp.single`. -/
recall lp.single

/-- The standard unit vector is `1` at its defining index and `0` at every other coordinate. -/

    ((lp.single 2 i (1 : ℝ) : ℓ²(I, ℝ)) j = if j = i then 1 else 0) := by
  simp [lp.single_apply, Pi.single_apply, eq_comm]

-- Proof sketch: apply the canonical formula `lp.inner_eq_tsum` for the Hilbert sum `ℓ²(I, ℝ)` and
-- simplify the real inner product on each coordinate to multiplication.
/-- In real `ℓ²(I)`, the inner product is the sum of the pointwise products of the coordinates. -/
