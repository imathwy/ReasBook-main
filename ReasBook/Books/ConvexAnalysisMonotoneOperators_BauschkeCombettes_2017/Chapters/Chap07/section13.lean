-- Proof sketch: for the convex-hull equality, use the convex-combination description of
-- `convexHull ℝ C` to show that every value `⟪x, u⟫` with `x ∈ convexHull ℝ C` is bounded by
-- `σ[C] u`, while monotonicity gives the reverse inequality from `C ⊆ convexHull ℝ C`. For the
-- closure equality, use continuity of `x ↦ ⟪x, u⟫` to pass the same upper bound from
-- `convexHull ℝ C` to `closure (convexHull ℝ C)`, and again use monotonicity for the opposite
-- inequality.
