/- Source/core/bridge triage:
- `source-facing`: Proposition 17.50 records interior-domain and continuity consequences for
  members of `Γ₀(H)`.
- `core/canonical`: the owner abstractions are `Γ₀(H)`, `interior (effectiveDomain f)`, and
  `ContinuousAtOnEffectiveDomain`.
- `bridge/view`: clause (1) is exactly Proposition 17.48 (2) specialized from `ConvexOn f
  (effectiveDomain f)` to the convexity field packaged by `hf : f ∈ Γ₀(H)`, so the file should
  reuse that owner directly instead of restating a parallel local theorem. -/

/- Proposition 17.50 (1): this is Proposition 17.48 (2) specialized to `hf.2 :
ConvexOn f (effectiveDomain f)`. -/

-- Proof sketch: Corollary 8.39 identifies the points where the finite real representative of a
-- convex lower semicontinuous function is continuous with `interior (effectiveDomain f)`. Since
-- membership in `Γ₀(H)` packages lower semicontinuity and convexity on the effective domain, this
-- yields continuity on the whole interior.
/-- Proposition 17.50 (2): every function in `Γ₀(H)` is continuous on the interior of its
effective domain. -/
