-- Proof sketch: identify clause (ii) with the strict first-order support inequality attached to
-- the Gâteaux derivative field `DT`, and identify clause (iii) with strict monotonicity of `DT`.
-- The equivalence between strict convexity and these first-order conditions is then obtained by
-- the standard segment argument on the open convex effective domain. For the final implication,
-- integrate the positive second-directional quadratic form along line segments to obtain strict
-- monotonicity of `DT`, which feeds back into the preceding equivalence.
/-- Proposition 17.10: on an open convex effective domain, strict convexity of `f` is equivalent
to the strict first-order lower-support inequality and to strict monotonicity of a Gâteaux
derivative field for the finite representative `x ↦ (f x : EReal).toReal`; moreover, for any
second Gâteaux derivative field on the effective domain, strict positivity of its quadratic form
implies strict monotonicity and hence these equivalent conditions. -/
