nonnegative monotonicity pairing. -/

nonnegative on every direction at every point of `U`. -/

-- Proof sketch: use the standard segment reduction to a one-variable function on an open interval.
-- The effective-domain nonemptiness hypothesis matches the project owner `ConvexOn`, which stores
-- properness as part of convexity on a set. Proposition 17.6 gives clause (ii) from convexity,
-- adding the two support inequalities yields clause (iii), and monotonicity of the derivative
-- along every segment gives convexity via Proposition 8.14. If a second derivative field is given
-- on the effective domain, then nonnegativity of its quadratic form is equivalent to monotonicity
-- of the first derivative field along line segments, so clause (iv) joins the same TFAE list. The
-- second-derivative field is recorded through the canonical owner `HasGateauxDerivativeOn` applied
-- to `DT`.
/-- Proposition 17.7: on a nonempty open convex effective domain, convexity of `f` is equivalent
to the first-order lower-support inequality and to monotonicity of a Gâteaux derivative field for
the finite representative `x ↦ (f x : EReal).toReal`; moreover, for any second Gâteaux derivative
field on the effective domain, these conditions are also equivalent to nonnegativity of its
quadratic form. -/
