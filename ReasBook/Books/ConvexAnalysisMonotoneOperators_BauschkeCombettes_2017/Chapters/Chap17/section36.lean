/- Source/core/bridge triage:
- `source-facing`: Proposition 17.36 records convex-analytic properties of the quadratic potential
  `q[A]` and its Fenchel conjugate.
- `core/canonical`: the owner abstractions are the chapter-level quadratic-potential owner `q[A]`
  and the canonical `Γ₀(H)`-valued conjugate owner `q⋆[A, hA_mono]`.
- `bridge/view`: this file should therefore use the existing conjugate owner from
  `Corollary_13_38`, not a parallel local `quadraticPotentialConjugate` wrapper.

-- Proof sketch: `q[A]` is continuous as a quadratic form built from a bounded
-- linear operator, so its `EReal` coercion is lower semicontinuous. Convexity is the monotone
-- quadratic-form criterion from Example 17.8, with the scalar factor `1 / 2` preserving convexity.
/-- The quadratic potential of a monotone bounded operator, viewed as a `]-∞,+∞]`-valued
function, belongs to `Γ₀(H)`. -/

/- Lean cannot parse the textbook subscripted star `q_A^*`, so we use the bracketed surface
`q⋆[A, hA_mono]` for the canonical `Γ₀(H)`-valued conjugate of the quadratic potential `q_A`. -/

-- Proof sketch: rewrite `q[A]` as the positive scalar multiple
-- `(1 / 2) • (fun x ↦ ⟪x, A x⟫_ℝ)` and apply the monotone quadratic-form characterization from
-- Example 17.8.

`q_A(x) = (1 / 2) ⟪x, A x⟫_ℝ` is convex on all of `H`. -/

-- Proof sketch: Example 2.57 gives the gradient of `x ↦ ⟪x, A x⟫_ℝ` as
-- `x ↦ (A + A.adjoint) x`; divide by `2` and use self-adjointness to simplify to `A x`.

operator `A`. -/

the quadratic potential of `A⁺` is `q_A ∘ A⁺`. -/
