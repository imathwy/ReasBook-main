-- Proof sketch: replace `C` by the nonempty closed convex cone `closure (cone C)`, whose polar
-- cone agrees with `Cᵒ⊖` by Proposition 6.24. Then apply the bipolar theorem for proper cones to
-- `closure (cone C)`. Equivalently, for the reverse inclusion, project onto `closure (cone C)` and
-- use Propositions 6.28 and 6.32 as in the textbook proof.
/-- Proposition 6.33: for a nonempty convex subset `C` of a real Hilbert space, the double polar
cone of `C` is the closure of the cone generated by `C`. -/
