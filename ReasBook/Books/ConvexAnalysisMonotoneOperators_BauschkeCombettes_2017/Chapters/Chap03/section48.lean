-- Proof sketch: The inclusion `closure (C ∩ interior D) ⊆ C ∩ closure D` follows from
-- `interior D ⊆ closure D` and closedness of `C`. For the reverse inclusion, fix
-- `x ∈ C ∩ interior D` and `y ∈ C ∩ closure D`; convexity puts the points
-- `α • x + (1 - α) • y` in `C ∩ interior D` for `0 < α ≤ 1`, and these converge to `y`.
/-- Proposition 3.48: if `C` and `D` are convex subsets of a real topological vector space, `C`
is closed, and `C ∩ interior D` is nonempty, then the closure of `C ∩ interior D` is
`C ∩ closure D`. -/
