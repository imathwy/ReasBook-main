-- Proof sketch: a Hilbert space is reflexive, so closed bounded sets are weakly compact after
-- passing to the weak topology. A norm-closed convex subset is weakly closed, hence a weakly
-- closed subset of a weakly compact closed ball and therefore weakly compact.
/-- Canonical weak compactness form of Theorem 3.37. The weak topology is expressed by viewing the
set inside `WeakSpace ℝ H`. -/
