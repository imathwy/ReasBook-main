/-- Helper for Theorem 3.34: weak sequential closedness of the weak-space image pulls back to
strong sequential closedness of the original set. -/
-- Proof sketch: a strongly convergent sequence becomes weakly convergent after applying the
-- canonical continuous map `toWeakSpace`, so sequential closedness of the weak image descends
-- along the injective preimage.

/-- Helper for Theorem 3.34: a closed convex set has weakly closed image in the weak space. -/

the original convex set. -/

-- weak closedness returns a witness from `C`, and injectivity of `toWeakSpace` identifies it
-- with `x`.

/-- Theorem 3.34: for a convex subset `C` of a real inner-product space, weak sequential closedness,
strong sequential closedness, strong closedness, and weak closedness are equivalent. The weak
conditions are expressed on the image of `C` in `WeakSpace ℝ 𝓗`. -/
-- Proof sketch: `(i) → (ii)` because norm convergence implies weak convergence. `(ii) ↔ (iii)`
-- because the norm topology is metrizable, hence sequential. `(iii) → (iv)` by the Hilbert-space
-- projection argument for closed convex sets, which shows weak limits of points of `C` remain in
-- `C`. `(iv) → (i)` because every weakly closed set is weakly sequentially closed.
