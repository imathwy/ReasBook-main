/-- Proposition 3.42 (3): If `C` and `D` are closed convex subsets of a Hilbert space and `D` is
bounded, then their Minkowski sum is closed. -/
-- Proof sketch: Take a convergent sequence in `C + D`, decompose it as `xₙ + yₙ` with `xₙ ∈ C`
-- and `yₙ ∈ D`, extract a weakly convergent subsequence from the bounded sequence `(yₙ)`, use
-- weak closedness of closed convex sets to keep the weak limits in `D` and `C`, and conclude that
-- the strong limit belongs to `C + D`.
