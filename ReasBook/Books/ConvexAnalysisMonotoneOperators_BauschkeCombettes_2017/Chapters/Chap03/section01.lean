/- Definition 3.1: for a subset `C` of a real `ℝ`-module `E` (hence in particular of a real
vector space), convexity is the canonical predicate `Convex ℝ C`. -/
recall Convex

-- Proof sketch: specialize `convex_iff_pointwise_add_subset` to coefficients `a` and `1 - a`,
-- then use `0 < a` and `a < 1` to obtain the required nonnegativity hypotheses; conversely,
-- recover the textbook one-parameter form from the standard two-parameter characterization.
/-- The textbook pointwise characterization of convexity says that `C` is closed under
combinations `a • x + (1 - a) • y` with `0 < a < 1`, expressed setwise as
`a • C + (1 - a) • C ⊆ C`. -/

/- Companion recall: a convex set is equivalently closed under pointwise convex combinations
`a • C + b • C` with nonnegative coefficients summing to `1`; specializing to `b = 1 - a`
recovers the textbook formula `a C + (1 - a) C ⊆ C` for `0 < a < 1`. -/

/- Companion recall: the textbook open-segment characterization of convexity is the standard theorem
`convex_iff_openSegment_subset`, whose `ℝ`-specialization matches the formulation using
open line segments `]x,y[`. -/
