/- Proof sketch: argue by contradiction, separating the cluster-point set into two disjoint closed
pieces with positive distance; then use `dist (u n) (u (n + 1)) → 0` and compactness to extract
a new cluster point whose distance to one piece lies strictly between `δ / 3` and `2 * δ / 3`,
contradicting the separation. -/
/-- Theorem 1.49: (Ostrowski) in a metric space, if `C` is compact, a sequence `u` takes values in
`C`, and `dist (u n) (u (n + 1)) → 0`, then the cluster-point set of `u` is connected. Under the
hypothesis `u n ∈ C`, every cluster point already lies in `C`, so this is equivalent to the
textbook formulation with `C ∩ {x | MapClusterPt x atTop u}`. -/
