-- Proof sketch: rewrite the ambient order by `ContinuousLinearMap.le_def`, express positivity via
-- `ContinuousLinearMap.isPositive_iff'`, and use that the difference of two self-adjoint operators
-- is self-adjoint to reduce to the quadratic-form inequality.
/-- Example 13.18 (1): on the real vector space of self-adjoint operators, the Loewner partial
order is the ambient operator order, characterized by `⟪A x, x⟫ ≤ ⟪B x, x⟫` for every `x`. -/
theorem loewner_le_iff_forall_inner_le (A B : S(H)) :
    A ≤ B ↔ ∀ x : H, ⟪(A : H →L[ℝ] H) x, x⟫_ℝ ≤ ⟪(B : H →L[ℝ] H) x, x⟫_ℝ := sorry

-- Proof sketch: expand the quadratic form of `B - A` and rearrange the resulting identity.
/-- Example 13.18 (2): the strict Loewner relation on `S(H)` is the Chapter 2 strict-monotonicity
condition for the operator difference `B - A`, equivalently `⟪A x, x⟫ < ⟪B x, x⟫` on every
nonzero vector. -/
