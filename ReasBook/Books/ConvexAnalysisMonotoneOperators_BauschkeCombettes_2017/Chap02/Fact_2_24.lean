/-- Fact 2.24: every continuous linear functional on a real Hilbert space is represented by a
unique vector through the inner product, and the representing vector has the same norm as the
functional. -/
-- Proof sketch: the representing vector is `(toDual ℝ H).symm f`; rewrite the Riesz equation
-- pointwise via the inner product, and use injectivity of `toDual` for uniqueness.
