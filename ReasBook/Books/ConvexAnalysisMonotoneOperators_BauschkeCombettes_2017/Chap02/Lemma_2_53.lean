-- Proof sketch: in finite dimension, the closure of a bounded set is compact. The cluster-point
-- set is closed, hence compact inside that closure, and `Theorem_1_49` gives connectedness from
-- the vanishing successive increments.
/-- Lemma 2.53: for a bounded sequence in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space whose successive
increments converge to `0`, the set of its cluster points, expressed via the canonical filter-based
notion `MapClusterPt`, is compact and connected. -/
