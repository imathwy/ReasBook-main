-- Proof sketch: compose the one-sided line derivatives from
-- `HasGateauxDerivativeWithinAt` with the Fréchet derivative of `R`; the additional Fréchet
-- conclusion is the standard composition theorem `HasFDerivAt.comp`.
/-- If `R` has Fréchet derivative `B` at `T x` and `T` has Gâteaux derivative `A` within `U`
at `x`, then `R ∘ T` has Gâteaux derivative `B.comp A` within `U` at `x`. -/

/-- Fact 2.63: if `R` has Fréchet derivative `B` at `T x` and `T` has Gâteaux derivative `A`
within `U` at `x`, then `R ∘ T` has Gâteaux derivative `B.comp A` within `U` at `x`; moreover,
if `T` is Fréchet differentiable at `x` with derivative `A`, then `R ∘ T` is Fréchet
differentiable at `x` with derivative `B.comp A`. -/
