/- Text 2.0.6: for real normed vector spaces `X` and `Y`, the textbook space
`\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})` of bounded linear maps is formalized by the canonical
mathlib type `ContinuousLinearMap`, written `X →L[ℝ] Y`; in particular,
`\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X})` is `X →L[ℝ] X`, and its operator norm is the ambient norm on this
space. -/
recall ContinuousLinearMap

/- The operator norm is exactly the supremum of `‖T x‖` over the closed unit ball, matching the
textbook definition. -/
