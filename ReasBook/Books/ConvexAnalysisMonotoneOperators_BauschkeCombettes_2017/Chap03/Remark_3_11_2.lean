-- Proof sketch: finite-dimensional subspaces are complete, hence admit orthogonal projections.
-- For each `x`, take `p := (C.orthogonalProjection x : 𝓗)`. The residual `x - p` is orthogonal to
-- `C`, so the Pythagorean identity shows `p` realizes `Metric.infDist x (C : Set 𝓗)`. Uniqueness
-- follows because two minimizers differ by a vector of `C` orthogonal to itself.
/-- Remark 3.11.2: every finite-dimensional linear subspace of a real Hilbert space admits a unique
best approximation to each point of the ambient space. -/
