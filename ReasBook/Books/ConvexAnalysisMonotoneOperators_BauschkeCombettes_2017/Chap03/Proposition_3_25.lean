-- Proof sketch: let `V := (Submodule.span ℝ C).topologicalClosure`. Since `C ⊆ V`, every
-- `z ∈ C` lies in `V`, while
-- `x - V.starProjection x ∈ Vᗮ` and `V.starProjection x - z ∈ V`. The Pythagorean identity then
-- gives `‖x - z‖ ^ 2 = ‖V.starProjection x - z‖ ^ 2 + ‖x - V.starProjection x‖ ^ 2`, so the
-- minimizing points in `C` for `x` and for `V.starProjection x` coincide. For the consequent,
-- use this equality of projector values together with `V.starProjection x ∈ V` and the fact that
-- `C`, viewed inside `V`, has the same distance-realizing points as in the ambient space.

/-- Proposition 3.25: the set-valued projector onto `C` is unchanged after orthogonal projection
onto the closed span of `C`, and consequently `C` is proximinal in the ambient Hilbert space if
and only if it is proximinal in its closed span. -/
