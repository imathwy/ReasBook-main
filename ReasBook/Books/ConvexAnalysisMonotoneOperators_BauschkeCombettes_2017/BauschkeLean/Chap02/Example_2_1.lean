/- Example 2.1: the Hilbert direct sum of a family of real Hilbert spaces is formalized by the
canonical `ℓ²` space `lp H 2` of square-summable dependent families. -/
recall lp

/- In the Hilbert direct sum `lp H 2`, the inner product is the coordinatewise series
`⟪x, y⟫ = ∑' i, ⟪x i, y i⟫`. -/
recall lp.inner_eq_tsum

/- The textbook net of finite partial sums is formalized by the canonical predicate `HasSum`,
whose default summation filter is unconditional convergence over finite subsets. -/
recall HasSum

/- The existence of such a sum is formalized by the canonical predicate `Summable`. -/
recall Summable
