-- Proof sketch: a Fréchet derivative gives the usual little-o control of
-- `T (x + h) - T x - A h` as `h → 0` within `C`. Because `C` is a neighborhood of `x`, every
-- direction from `x` stays inside `C` along a short positive segment, so substituting `h = α • y`
-- and dividing by `α > 0` yields the one-sided directional limit defining the Gâteaux derivative
-- with the same operator `A`.
/-- Lemma 2.61 (1): if `C` is a neighborhood of `x` and `A` is the Fréchet derivative of `T` at
`x` within `C`, then for every direction `y` the one-sided directional difference quotient tends to
`A y`; equivalently, `T` is Gâteaux differentiable there and the two derivatives coincide. -/

-- Proof sketch: a Fréchet derivative within `C` implies continuity within `C` at `x` by the
-- standard calculus theorem. Since `C` is a neighborhood of `x`, continuity within `C` upgrades to
-- ordinary continuity at `x`.
/-- Lemma 2.61 (2): if `C` is a neighborhood of `x` and `T` is Fréchet differentiable at `x`
within `C`, then `T` is continuous at `x`. -/
