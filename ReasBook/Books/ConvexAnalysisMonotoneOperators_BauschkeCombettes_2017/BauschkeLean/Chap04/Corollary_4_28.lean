-- Proof sketch: closed convex subsets of a real Hilbert space are weakly sequentially closed by
-- Theorem 3.34. Apply the demiclosedness principle from Theorem 4.27 to the residual map
-- `x ↦ x - T x` at `0`; the residual convergence hypothesis then forces `T x = x`.
/-- Corollary 4.28: if `D` is a closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space, `T : D → H` is
nonexpansive, `xₙ` converges weakly to `x` in `D`, and the residuals `xₙ - T xₙ` converge strongly
to `0`, then `x` is a fixed point of `T`. -/
