/- Definition 8.1: the textbook real-height epigraph of an extended-real-valued function is the
canonical set `epigraph f` already introduced in Definition 1.4; concretely, it consists of the
pairs `(x, ξ) : H × ℝ` with `f x ≤ ξ`. In this chapter, convexity of `f` is expressed by
`Convex ℝ (epigraph f)`, and concavity by convexity of the epigraph of `-f`. -/
recall epigraph

/- Companion recall: membership in the real-height epigraph is exactly the inequality `f x ≤ ξ`. -/
recall mem_epigraph_iff

/- Companion recall: the textbook statement that `f` is convex is expressed by the proposition
`Convex ℝ (epigraph f)`. -/
#check Convex ℝ (epigraph f)

/- Companion recall: the textbook statement that `f` is concave is expressed by convexity of the
real-height epigraph of `-f`. -/
#check Convex ℝ (epigraph (-f))
