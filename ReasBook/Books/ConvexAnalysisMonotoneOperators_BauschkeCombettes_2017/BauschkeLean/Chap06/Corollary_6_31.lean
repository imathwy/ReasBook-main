-- Proof sketch: since `y ∈ K` and `z ∈ Kᵒ⊖`, one has `⟪y, z⟫ ≤ 0`. If equality held, then the
-- strict norm inequalities from the previous two clauses together with Theorem 6.30 would force
-- `‖x‖² > ‖x‖²`, a contradiction; finally use Theorem 6.30 to identify the projection inner
-- product with `0`.
/-- Corollary 6.31 (3): clause (ii). Under the same decomposition hypotheses, the inner product
`⟪y, z⟫` is strictly smaller than the inner product of the projections of `x` onto `K` and `Kᵒ⊖`.
By Theorem 6.30, that projection inner product is `0`. -/
