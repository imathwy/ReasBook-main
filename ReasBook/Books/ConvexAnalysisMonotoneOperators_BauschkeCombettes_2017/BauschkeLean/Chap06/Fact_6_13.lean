-- Proof sketch: the cited external corollary says that a surjective continuous linear image of a
-- closed convex set in a Hilbert space has interior equal to core.  Apply it to the closed convex
-- product `C ×ˢ D` under the continuous linear map `(x, y) ↦ x - y`.
/-- External dependency for Fact 6.13, corresponding to Corollary 13.2 of the cited source: a
surjective continuous linear image of a closed convex subset of a Hilbert space has interior equal
to core. -/
