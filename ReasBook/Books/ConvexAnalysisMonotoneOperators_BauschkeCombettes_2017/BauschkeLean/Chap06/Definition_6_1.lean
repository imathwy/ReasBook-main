-- Route correction: the file uses the imported project notion `IsCone = (Ioi 0) • _`,
-- so the proofs proceed through the `sInter` universal property of that existing notion.

-- Proof sketch: for the forward direction, rewrite `IsCone K` using the existing project
-- definition and unpack membership in a pointwise scalar multiple; for the reverse direction,
-- use the nonnegative-scalar closure hypothesis with `1 ≥ 0` and the existing characterization
-- of `IsCone`.
/-- The project predicate `IsCone` is the positive-scalar cone convention used earlier in the
book.  It is not the closed-under-`0` convention; the latter would force every cone to contain
`0`, which is not the convention formalized in `Text_1_0_2`. -/
