-- Proof sketch: for the forward implication, use the defining best-approximation condition to show
-- that every point in the closure of `C` already belongs to `C`. For the reverse implication, fix
-- `x`, choose a minimizing sequence in the nonempty closed set `C`, use compactness of closed
-- bounded sets in finite dimensions to extract a convergent subsequence with limit in `C`, and
-- show that the limit realizes `Metric.infDist x C`.
/-- Corollary 3.15: in a finite-dimensional real Hilbert space, a nonempty set is proximal if and
only if it is closed. -/
