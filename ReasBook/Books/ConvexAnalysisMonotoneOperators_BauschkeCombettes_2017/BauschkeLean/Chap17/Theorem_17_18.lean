-- Proof sketch: Proposition 16.17 gives that `∂ f(x)` is nonempty and weakly compact at a
-- continuity point on the effective domain. Proposition 17.17 identifies the conjugate of
-- `f'(x; ·)` with the indicator of `∂ f(x)`, and Example 13.3 rewrites the conjugate of this
-- indicator as the support function of `∂ f(x)`. Fenchel--Moreau then yields the claimed identity.
/-- Theorem 17.18: for a convex `]-∞,+∞]`-valued function, the directional derivative at a
continuity point on the effective domain is the support function of the subdifferential there. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply Theorem 17.18 to rewrite the directional derivative as the support function
-- of `∂ f(x)`. Proposition 16.17 makes `∂ f(x)` weakly compact and nonempty, so the weakly
-- continuous functional `u ↦ ⟪y, u⟫` attains its maximum on `∂ f(x)`.
/-- At a continuity point on the effective domain, each directional derivative is attained by some
subgradient. -/
