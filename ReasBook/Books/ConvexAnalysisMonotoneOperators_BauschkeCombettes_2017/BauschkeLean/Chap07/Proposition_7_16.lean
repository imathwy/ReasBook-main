-- Proof sketch: if `u ∈ orthogonalSet C`, then `⟪x, u⟫ = 0` for every `x ∈ C`, hence in particular
-- `⟪x, u⟫ ≤ 0`; rewriting with `mem_orthogonalSet` and `mem_polarCone_iff_forall_inner_nonpos`

-- Proof sketch: every inequality `⟪x, u⟫ ≤ 0` required for `u ∈ Cᵒ⊖` is stronger than the

-- Proof sketch: if `x ∈ C`, then every `u ∈ Cᵒ⊙` satisfies `⟪x, u⟫ ≤ 1`, so `x ∈ (Cᵒ⊙)ᵒ⊙`; the

-- Proof sketch: if `C ⊆ D`, then every inequality defining membership in `Dᵒ⊙` is among the
-- inequalities defining membership in `Cᵒ⊙`, so the polar-set operation is antitone.
