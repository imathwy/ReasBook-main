/-- Lemma 1.35: if a sequence in a sequentially compact subset has a unique
sequential cluster point, expressed by the canonical predicate `IsSequentialClusterPt`, then the
whole sequence converges to that point. -/
-- Proof sketch: argue by contradiction. If `u` does not converge to `x`, choose a neighborhood of
-- `x` missed infinitely often and extract a subsequence in `C \ U`. Sequential compactness of `C`
-- gives a further convergent subsequence with limit `y`; by uniqueness of sequential cluster
-- points, `y = x`. This contradicts eventual membership in `U` for a subsequence converging to
-- `x`.
