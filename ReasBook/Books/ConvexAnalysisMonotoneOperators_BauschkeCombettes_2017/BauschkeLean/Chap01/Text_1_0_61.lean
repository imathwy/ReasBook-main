/-- Text 1.0.61: for an extended-real-valued function on a sequential topological space, lower
semicontinuity is equivalent to sequential lower semicontinuity, meaning that every convergent
sequence satisfies the liminf inequality at its limit.
-/
-- Proof sketch: use `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_preimage` to identify lower
-- semicontinuity with closedness of all real sublevel sets, then use `isSeqClosed_iff_isClosed`
-- in a sequential space to pass between closedness and sequential closedness. The sequential
-- closedness of all sublevel sets is equivalent to the stated sequence-`liminf` inequality.
