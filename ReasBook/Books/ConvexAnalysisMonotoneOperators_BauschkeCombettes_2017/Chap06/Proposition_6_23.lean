-- Proof sketch: use `mem_negativePolar`, `mem_positivePolar`, and `Submodule.mem_orthogonal`.
-- Because a submodule is closed under negation, the nonpositive and nonnegative inner-product
-- inequalities force vanishing, and conversely vanishing implies both inequalities.
/-- Proposition 6.23: if `C` is a linear subspace of a real Hilbert space, then its negative and
positive polar cones are both equal to the orthogonal complement `Cᗮ`, hence to each other and to
the textbook orthogonal set `C^⊥`. -/
