-- The textbook notation `\overline{\operatorname{spts}}\, C` is formalized as `closure (spts C)`.

-- Proof sketch: unfold `supportingHyperplane` and rewrite membership with
-- `mem_innerProductLevelSet_iff`.
/-- Membership in the supporting hyperplane through `x` with normal vector `u` is the equation
`⟪y, u⟫_ℝ = ⟪x, u⟫_ℝ`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `supportPoints` and simplify the set-membership statement.

`innerSupremumOn C` at that point. -/
