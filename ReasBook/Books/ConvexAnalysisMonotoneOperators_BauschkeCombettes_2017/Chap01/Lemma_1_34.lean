/-- Lemma 1.34 (1): a sequentially compact subset of a Hausdorff space is sequentially closed. -/
-- Proof sketch: given a convergent sequence in `C`, use sequential compactness to extract a
-- convergent subsequence with limit in `C`; in a Hausdorff space the subsequence has the same limit
-- as the original sequence, so the ambient limit belongs to `C`.

compact. -/
-- Proof sketch: start with a sequence in `A`; since `A ⊆ C`, sequential compactness of `C`
-- provides a convergent subsequence with limit in `C`; sequential closedness of `A` forces that
-- limit to lie in `A`, yielding sequential compactness of `A`.
