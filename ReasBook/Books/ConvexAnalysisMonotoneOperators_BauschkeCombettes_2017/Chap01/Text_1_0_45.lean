/-- Text 1.0.45: for a net `ξ : A → X`, the canonical predicate `MapClusterPt x Filter.atTop ξ`
means that every neighborhood of `x` is visited arbitrarily far out in the directed index set. -/
-- Proof sketch: unfold `MapClusterPt`, rewrite cluster points using
-- `mapClusterPt_iff_frequently`, and then rewrite frequent membership in `Filter.atTop`
-- as the textbook tail condition.
