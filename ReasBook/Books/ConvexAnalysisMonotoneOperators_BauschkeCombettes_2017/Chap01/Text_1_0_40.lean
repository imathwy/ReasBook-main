/- Text 1.0.40: the boundary `bdry C` of a subset `C` of a topological space is formalized by
the canonical set `frontier C`. -/
recall frontier {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (C : Set X) : Set X

/- Its defining equation in mathlib is the canonical theorem `closure_diff_interior`. -/
recall closure_diff_interior {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (C : Set X) :
    closure C \ interior C = frontier C
