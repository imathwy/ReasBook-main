/-- A function is a lower semicontinuous convex minorant of `f` exactly when it is lower
semicontinuous, has convex epigraph, and is pointwise dominated by `f`. -/
-- Proof sketch: unfold `lowerSemicontinuousConvexMinorants`; membership in the defining set is
-- exactly the displayed conjunction.

all lower semicontinuous convex minorants of `f` at that point. -/
