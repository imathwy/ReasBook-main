/-- Proposition 1.3.4: the inverse of the basepoint-change equivalence associated to a path
`a : Path x y` is the basepoint-change equivalence associated to the reversed path `a.symm`. -/
-- Proof sketch: `γ[a]` is conjugation by the isomorphism in the fundamental groupoid represented
-- by `a`. The inverse of that conjugation is conjugation by the inverse isomorphism, and the
-- inverse isomorphism is represented by the reversed path `a.symm`.
