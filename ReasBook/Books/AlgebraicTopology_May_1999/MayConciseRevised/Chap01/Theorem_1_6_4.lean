/-- Theorem 1.6.4: every continuous self-map of the closed unit disk `D²` has a fixed point. -/
-- Proof sketch: argue by contradiction. If `f` had no fixed point, then
-- `fixedPointFreeDiskRetraction` would give a continuous retraction of the disk onto its boundary
-- circle, contradicting `no_continuous_retraction_closed_unit_disk_to_circle`.
