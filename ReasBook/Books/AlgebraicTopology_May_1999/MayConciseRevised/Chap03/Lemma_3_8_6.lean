/- The owner fact behind Lemma 3.8.6 (2): the path-class space is locally path connected. -/
-- Proof sketch: the standard basic neighborhoods from Construction 3.8.3 are indexed by suitable
-- open neighborhoods in `B`. By Lemma 3.8.5, each such basic neighborhood is identified with its
-- indexing neighborhood, which is path connected by definition, so these basic sets form a
-- path-connected neighborhood basis on the total space.

/- The owner fact behind Lemma 3.8.6 (3): the path-class space is simply connected. -/
-- Proof sketch: a loop in the total space based at the class of the constant path projects to a
-- loop in `B`. The endpoint-fixed path-class construction identifies the endpoint of the lifted
-- loop with the resulting path class in `B`, so a loop can close only when that class is trivial.
-- This makes every based loop null-homotopic, hence the total space is simply connected.
