/-- ProofStep 2.7.4: once a path homotopy square has been subdivided so that each small subsquare
lies inside a single cover member, the equality of the two boundary paths is reduced to the
endpoint-fixed homotopy relation already valid in that individual fundamental groupoid `Π(U)`.
Any functor out of `Π(U)` therefore identifies the two boundary paths, which is the local relation
used in the van Kampen subdivision argument. -/
-- Proof sketch: in a single open set `U`, endpoint-fixed homotopic paths define the same morphism
-- of `Π(U)` by the quotient relation on `Path.Homotopic.Quotient`. After rewriting the two arrows
-- with `FundamentalGroupoid.fromPath`, functoriality of `F` carries that equality into the target
-- category.
