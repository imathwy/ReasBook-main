variable (X : TopCat)

/- Definition 2.4.1: the category `T` of based spaces is the under category of the terminal
topological space, so its objects are spaces equipped with chosen basepoints and its morphisms are
continuous maps preserving those basepoints. -/
#check Under (⊤_ TopCat)

/- A based space with underlying space `X` is given primitively by a map from the one-point space
into `X`, equivalently by a chosen basepoint of `X`. -/
#check (Under.mk : (⊤_ TopCat ⟶ X) → Under (⊤_ TopCat))

/- The categorical structure on based spaces is the inherited category structure on this under
category. -/
#check (inferInstance : Category (Under (⊤_ TopCat)))
