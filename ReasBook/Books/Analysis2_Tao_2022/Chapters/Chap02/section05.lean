/-- Definition 2.12: A topological space is a pair `(X, O)` consisting of a set `X` and a collection
`O` subset `2^X` such that (1) the empty set and `X` are in `O`, (2) finite intersections of members of
`O` are in `O`, and (3) arbitrary unions of members of `O` are in `O`; the members of `O` are
called open sets and `O` is called a topology on `X`. In Lean we bundle this as a type equipped with a
`TopologicalSpace` structure. -/

and `x ∈ U`. -/

/-- Definition 2.14: [Topological convergence] Let `(X, 𝓕)` be a topological space, let `m ∈ ℤ`,
and let `(x^{(n)})_{n=m}^{∞}` be a sequence in `X`. For `x ∈ X`, the sequence converges to `x` iff
for every neighborhood `V` of `x` there exists an integer `N ≥ m` such that `x^{(n)} ∈ V` for all
integers `n ≥ N`. -/

/-- Definition 2.15: [Interior point, exterior point, boundary point] Let `(X, 𝓕)` be a
topological space, let `E ⊆ X`, and let `x0 ∈ X`. (1) `x0` is an interior point of `E` iff there
exists a neighborhood `V` of `x0` with `V ⊆ E`. (2) `x0` is an exterior point of `E` iff there
exists a neighborhood `V` of `x0` with `V ∩ E = ∅`. (3) `x0` is a boundary point of `E` iff it is
neither interior nor exterior; equivalently, for every neighborhood `V` of `x0`, both `V ∩ E ≠ ∅`
and `V ∩ (X \ E) ≠ ∅`. -/

/-- Definition 2.16 (Closure point): Let `(X, 𝓕)` be a topological space and `E ⊆ X`. (1) A point
`x0 ∈ X` is an adherent point of `E` iff for every neighborhood `V` of `x0` (i.e., `V` contains an
open set containing `x0`), one has `V ∩ E ≠ ∅`. (2) The closure `\overline{E}` is the set of all
adherent points of `E`: `\overline{E} = {x ∈ X : for every neighborhood V of x, V ∩ E ≠ ∅}`. -/
def closureSetTopological {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (E : Set X) : Set X :=
  {x | IsAdherentPointTopological E x}

/-- Definition 2.17: Let `(X, 𝓕)` be a topological space and `K ⊆ X`. The set `K` is closed iff
its complement `X \ K` is open (i.e. `X \ K ∈ 𝓕`). -/
abbrev IsClosedTopological {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (K : Set X) : Prop :=
  IsClosed K

/-- Definition 2.18: [Relative topology] Let `(X, 𝓕)` be a topological space and `Y ⊆ X`. Define
`𝓕_Y := {V ∩ Y : V ∈ 𝓕}`; this collection is the relative (subspace) topology on `Y`, and the
pair `(Y, 𝓕_Y)` is a topological subspace of `(X, 𝓕)`. -/
def relativeTopology {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] (Y : Set X) : Set (Set X) :=
  {U : Set X | ∃ V : Set X, IsOpen V ∧ U = V ∩ Y}

/-- Definition 2.19: (Continuous functions) Let `(X, 𝓕_X)` and `(Y, 𝓕_Y)` be topological spaces
and let `f : X → Y`. For `x0 ∈ X`, the function `f` is continuous at `x0` iff for every
neighborhood `V` of `f x0` there exists a neighborhood `U` of `x0` such that `f '' U ⊆ V`.
The function `f` is continuous iff it is continuous at every point `x ∈ X`. -/
def IsContinuousAtTopological {X Y : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y]
    (f : X → Y) (x0 : X) : Prop :=

/-- Definition 2.20: (1) A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.
(2) A subset `Y ⊆ X` is compact if the subspace topology on `Y` is compact; in Lean we use
`IsCompact Y`, and the space is compact iff `IsCompact (Set.univ : Set X)`. -/

/-- Definition 2.22 (Hausdorff topological space): A topological space is Hausdorff if for any
distinct points `x, y` there exist neighborhoods `V` of `x` and `W` of `y` with `V ∩ W = ∅`. -/
abbrev IsHausdorffTopological (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop :=

/-- Definition 2.23: [Order topology] Let `(X, ≤)` be a totally ordered set. A set `V ⊆ X` is open
if for every `x ∈ V` there exists a set `I` with `x ∈ I ⊆ V`, where `I` is an interval
`{y : X | a < y ∧ y < b}`, a ray `{y : X | a < y}` or `{y : X | y < b}`, or the whole space `X`;
the collection of such open sets defines the order topology on `X`. -/

/-- Definition 2.24 (Cofinite topology): Let `X` be a set and define
`𝓕 := {E ⊆ X | E = ∅ or X \ E` is finite}. The pair `(X, 𝓕)` is called the cofinite topology on
`X`. In Lean this is the `TopologicalSpace` structure induced by the `CofiniteTopology` type
synonym. -/
