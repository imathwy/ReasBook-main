-- Proof sketch: apply the projection variational inequality to `v` with test point `P_C(w)` and to
-- `w` with test point `P_C(v)`, then add the resulting inequalities and rearrange the inner-product
-- terms to obtain the standard firm nonexpansiveness estimate.
/-- Theorem 5.4 (1): the point projection onto a nonempty closed convex set in a complete real
inner product space, hence in particular in a Euclidean space, is firmly nonexpansive. -/
