/- Theorem 6.41 is `source-facing`: the textbook object is the projection point of a convex set,
and the chapter's canonical owner for that object is the set-valued projection mapping `Proj[C]`
used throughout Chapter 6. Domain sampling for this item uses the local owner
`projection_mapping`, the companion membership lemma `mem_projection_mapping_iff`, the first-order
criterion `norm_eq_iInf_iff_real_inner_le_zero` from mathlib's Hilbert projection API, and the
owner-level convex uniqueness theorem `projection_mapping_subsingleton` from Theorem 6.24. These
show that the primitive data are only the convex set `C`, the base point `x`, and the candidate
projection point `u ∈ C`; closure, nonemptiness, and finite-dimensional completeness are not part
of the core variational statement. The owner-level derived API here is the variational
characterization of membership in `Proj[C] x`; the textbook singleton identity `Proj[C] x = {u}` is then
a thin source-facing wrapper over that characterization together with the owner uniqueness theorem,
rather than a new point-valued projection wrapper. -/

/-- Helper for Theorem 6.41: for a convex set `C`, a point `u ∈ C` belongs to the projection set
`Proj[C] x` exactly when it satisfies the Hilbert-space variational inequality against every point of
`C`. -/

-- Proof sketch: first rewrite the variational condition as membership in `Proj[C] x` via
-- `mem_projection_mapping_iff_inner_le_zero`. Since `C` is convex, the owner theorem
-- `projection_mapping_subsingleton` shows that `Proj[C] x` is a subsingleton, so membership of `u`
-- upgrades immediately to the singleton identity `Proj[C] x = {u}`.
/-- Theorem 6.41: second projection theorem. For a convex set `C` and a point `u ∈ C`, the
equality `Proj[C] x = {u}` holds if and only if `inner ℝ (x - u) (y - u) ≤ 0` for every `y ∈ C`.
The usual nonempty and closed hypotheses are unnecessary for this variational characterization
once a candidate point `u ∈ C` is fixed. -/
