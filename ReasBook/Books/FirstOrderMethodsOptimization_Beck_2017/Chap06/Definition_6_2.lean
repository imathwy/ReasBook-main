variable {α : Type*} [Ring α] [LinearOrder α]

/- Definition 6.2 is `source-facing`: domain sampling against
`Mathlib.Data.Sign.Defs`, `Mathlib.Data.Sign.Basic`, and
`Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Group.PosPart` shows that the primitive scalar ingredients are already the
canonical upstream owners `sign` and `(·)⁺`. The new owner here is therefore only the
soft-thresholding map built from those generic ordered-ring primitives, while its piecewise
description remains derived API. -/

/-- Definition 6.2: the soft thresholding function with parameter `λ` is the map
`y ↦ (|y| - λ)⁺ * sign y`. -/
def soft_thresholding (lam : α) : α → α :=
  fun y ↦ (|y| - lam)⁺ * sign y

/-- Textbook notation for the soft thresholding operator. -/
notation "𝒯[" l "]" => soft_thresholding l

-- Proof sketch: unfold `soft_thresholding`; the statement is exactly the defining positive-part
-- and sign formula, so it follows by definitional reduction.
/-- Evaluating the soft-thresholding operator gives its defining positive-part/sign formula. -/
@[simp] theorem soft_thresholding_apply (lam y : α) :
    𝒯[lam] y = (|y| - lam)⁺ * sign y := rfl

variable {α : Type*} [Ring α] [LinearOrder α] [IsStrictOrderedRing α]

-- Proof sketch: assume `0 ≤ λ` and split into the three regimes `λ ≤ y`, `|y| < λ`, and
-- `y ≤ -λ`. In each regime, simplify `( |y| - λ )⁺` and `sign y` to obtain the displayed
-- branch value.
/-- For a nonnegative threshold, soft thresholding has the usual three-branch piecewise
presentation. -/
