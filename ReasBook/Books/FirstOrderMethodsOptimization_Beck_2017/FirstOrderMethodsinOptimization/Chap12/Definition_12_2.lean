/- Definition 12.2 is `bridge/view`: it rewrites the Chapter 12 primal objective into a split
optimization problem on pairs `(x, z)` constrained by `z = A x`.

Domain sampling identifies the owner abstractions already present upstream:
- `source-facing`: the split reformulation of the primal infimum;
- `core/canonical`: Chapter 10's `composite_model_objective` for pointwise sums, Chapter 12's
  `dual_based_proximal_gradient_primal_optimal_value` for the primal infimum, and mathlib's
  `Set.graphOn` for the graph constraint;
- `bridge/view`: restricting the canonical product objective
  `composite_model_objective (f ∘ Prod.fst) (g ∘ Prod.snd)` to `univ.graphOn A`, which recovers
  the canonical primal objective `composite_model_objective f (g ∘ A)`.

Primitive data are only the summands `f`, `g`, and the map `A`; the product-space objective and
feasible set should therefore be thin specializations of those owners rather than bespoke wrapper
definitions. -/

-- Proof sketch: identify the feasible set with the graph of `A`; every feasible pair has the form
-- `(x, A x)`, and on that graph the canonical product objective
-- `composite_model_objective (f ∘ Prod.fst) (g ∘ Prod.snd)` coincides with the Chapter 12 primal
-- objective `composite_model_objective f (g ∘ A)`, so the split infimum is exactly the canonical
-- primal optimal value.
/-- Definition 12.2: the primal problem `min_x (f x + g (A x))` can equivalently be rewritten as
minimizing the split objective `(x, z) ↦ f x + g z` over the graph-feasible pairs satisfying
`A x = z`. -/
