variable [TopologicalSpace E] (g : E → EReal)

/- Definition 2.4: an extended-real-valued function is continuous over its domain exactly when it
is continuous on its effective domain in the canonical mathlib sense `ContinuousOn g
(effective_domain g)`. -/

section

variable [TopologicalSpace E] [FirstCountableTopology E] {g : E → EReal}

-- Proof sketch: rewrite `ContinuousOn g (effective_domain g)` as continuity of the restricted
-- map on the subtype `effective_domain g`, use `continuous_iff_seqContinuous`, then translate the
-- subtype convergence hypothesis back to ambient convergence with `tendsto_subtype_rng`.
/-- In a first-countable domain, continuity of an extended-real-valued function on its effective
domain is equivalent to preservation of limits of sequences valued in that domain. -/
