/- `prompt_add/` is absent in this workspace, so the owner choice is sampled from the nearby
Chapter 10, Chapter 12, and Chapter 15 optimization files.

This item is `source-facing`: it rewrites the linear-composite problem
`min_x (f₁ x + f₂ (A x))` as the split equality-constrained problem on `(x, z)` with constraint
`A x = z`.

Domain sampling identifies the owner stack already present upstream:
- `core/canonical`: `H[f₁, f₂] = admm_objective f₁ f₂` from Definition 15.1 for the product-space
  objective `(x, z) ↦ f₁ x + f₂ z`;
- `core/canonical`: `H_opt[f₁, f₂; A, B, c] = admm_problem_value ...` from Definition 15.1 for
  affine-constrained ADMM values;
- `bridge/view`: `composite_model_objective f₁ (f₂ ∘ A)` from Definition 15.6 for the original
  linear-composite objective;
- `source-facing`: the split graph constraint `A x = z`, represented canonically as `univ.graphOn
  A`.

Primitive data are only `f₁`, `f₂`, and `A`. The bridge is therefore stated directly with the
canonical graph owner `univ.graphOn A` and the existing Chapter 15 value owner `H_opt[...]`,
rather than rebuilding chapter-local wrappers for the same graph and infimum. The first layer
stays over a plain map `A : X → Z`; only the later bridge to `H_opt[f₁, f₂; A, -id, 0]`
reintroduces linearity and additive structure. -/

-- Proof sketch: identify the graph-feasible set with `univ.graphOn A`; every feasible pair has
-- the form `(x, A x)`, and on that graph `H[f₁, f₂]` agrees with the linear-composite
-- objective, so the two sets of attainable values have the same infimum.
/-- Definition 15.7: the problem `min_x (f₁ x + f₂ (A x))` is equivalently written as minimizing
the ADMM objective `H[f₁, f₂]` over the graph-feasible pairs satisfying `A x = z`, equivalently
`A x - z = 0` when subtraction is available. -/

-- Proof sketch: rewrite the feasible set as the specialized ADMM feasible set
-- `A x + (-id) z = 0`. The constrained problem objective contributes only the feasible values
