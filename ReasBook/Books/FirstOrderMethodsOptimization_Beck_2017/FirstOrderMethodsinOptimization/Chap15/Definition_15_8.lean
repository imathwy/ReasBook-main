/- Semantic recall via `lean_leansearch` is unavailable in this runner, so the owner choice is
sampled from the nearby optimization files, the Chapter 3 constrained-objective owner, the
Chapter 6 Euclidean `ℓ¹` owner, and the Chapter 15 linear-map-based API.

This item is `source-facing`: it defines the basis-pursuit model `min l1n[x]` subject to `A x = b`.
The best `core/canonical` owner split already exists upstream:
- `constrained_problem_objective` owns the constrained extended-real objective;
- `EuclideanSpace.l1Norm`, written `l1n[x]`, owns the Euclidean `ℓ¹` term on finite product spaces;
- Chapter 15 treats the forward operator canonically as a linear map `A : X →ₗ[ℝ] Y`.

Primitive data are therefore only the linear constraint fiber `A ⁻¹' {b}` and the `ℓ¹` objective.
The matrix presentation from the textbook is a `bridge/view` obtained by specializing `A` to
`Matrix.toEuclideanLin`. -/

/-- Definition 15.8: the basis-pursuit problem (15.28) is the constrained objective with `ℓ¹`
objective and affine feasible set `A x = b`. -/

/-- Helper for Definition 15.8: on the affine feasible set `A x = b`, the basis-pursuit problem
agrees with the `ℓ¹` objective `l1n[x]`. -/
