/- Definition 13.10 is `source-facing`: the item introduces a concrete quadratic program on
`ℝ^n` with feasible set the convex hull of finitely many points. The relevant `core/canonical`
owners already present in the project are:

- `quadratic_affine_function` from Definition 4.4 for the quadratic objective
  `x ↦ (1 / 2) xᵀ Q x + bᵀ x`;
- `constrained_problem_objective` from Definition 3.15 for the constrained optimization owner.

The primitive data for this owner are therefore only the matrix `Q`, the linear term `b`, and the
finite vertex family `a`. Positive-definiteness of `Q` is a later property used by downstream
algorithms and optimality statements, not part of the defining owner itself. The clean public API
is therefore a direct specialization of the constrained-problem owner, with separate source-facing
names for the feasible set `Ω`, the quadratic objective `f_q`, and the optimal value `f_opt`. The
only nontrivial bridge needed here is the canonical Chapter 9 lift `Function.toEReal`, which
replaces a raw lambda coercion in the constrained objective. -/

/- The objective and constrained-problem owners already exist upstream; Definition 13.10 only
specializes them to the finite-hull quadratic setting. -/

and feasible set `Ω = conv{a₁, a₂, …, a_l}`, is the constrained objective obtained by restricting
`x ↦ (1 / 2) xᵀ Q x + bᵀ x` to `Ω`. In the textbook setting, later results further assume
