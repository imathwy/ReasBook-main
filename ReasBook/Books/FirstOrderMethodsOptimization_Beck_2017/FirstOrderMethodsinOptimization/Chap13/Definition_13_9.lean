/- Definition 13.9 is a `bridge/view` specialization of the Chapter 10 constrained/composite
owner API.

Domain sampling in the relevant optimization owner layer:
- `constrained_problem_objective` from Chapter 3 for `min {f x : x ∈ C}`;
- `constrained_problem_solutions` and `unconstrained_problem_solutions` from Chapter 8 for the
  solution-set owners;
- `composite_model_objective` from Chapter 10 for the composite objective `f + g`;
- the Chapter 10 bridge theorems
  `unconstrained_problem_solutions_constrained_problem_objective_eq` and
  `unconstrained_problem_solutions_composite_model_objective_extendedIndicator_eq`.

Primitive data are only `f`, `C`, and the indicator specialization `g = extendedIndicator C`.
The Chapter 10 solution-set equalities are the owner-level statements; the `IsMinOn` lemmas below
are thin companions obtained by rewriting membership in those owner sets. This keeps feasibility
explicit on the constrained side, which is mathematically necessary. -/

/- Definition 13.9: the constrained objective already has the canonical owner-level solution-set
bridge in Chapter 10. -/

/- Definition 13.9: after specializing the nonsmooth term to `extendedIndicator C`, the composite
model already has the canonical owner-level solution-set bridge in Chapter 10. -/

objective on `E` is exactly being a feasible minimizer of `f` on `C`. -/
