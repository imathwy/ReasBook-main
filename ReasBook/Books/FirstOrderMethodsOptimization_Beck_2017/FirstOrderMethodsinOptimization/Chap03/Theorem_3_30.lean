Theorem 3.30 is a `source-facing` Fermat criterion for the chapter owner notion
`subdifferential`. Its primitive data are already owned upstream:
`effective_domain` comes from Chapter 2, while
`subdifferential` is the derived set of `is_subgradient_at` from Definitions 3.1 and 3.2.
This file therefore reuses that owner API directly instead of introducing a parallel local copy.

-- Proof sketch: if `x` minimizes `f` on all of `E`, a point of `effective_domain f` supplies
-- some `y` with `f y < ⊤`, hence also `f x < ⊤`; then the subgradient inequality for the zero
-- functional is
-- exactly the global minimality inequality. Conversely, if `0 ∈ ∂ f(x)`, unfold
-- `subdifferential`; the zero functional kills `y - x`, leaving `f x ≤ f y` for every `y`.
/-- Theorem 3.30: Fermat's optimality condition for the chapter's extended-real subdifferential.
If the effective domain of an extended-real-valued function is nonempty, then a point is a global
minimizer exactly when the zero dual vector belongs to its subdifferential. -/

/- The real-valued strong-dual formulation is a `bridge/view` corollary of the source-facing
owner theorem above. The primitive data still belongs to `subdifferential`; `subdifferentialAt`
is only the canonical real-valued view used later in the chapter. -/
