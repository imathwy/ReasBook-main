/- Remark 6.7 is `bridge/view`: the source rewrites the separable proximal-operator identity from
Theorem 6.6 into textbook tuple notation once each coordinate proximal set is known to be a
singleton. Domain sampling in this file family identifies the owner abstraction as the Chapter 6
pair `separableSum` on `PiLp (2 : ENNReal) E` and the set-valued proximal mapping `prox[...]`;
`EuclideanSpace ℝ ι` is only the textbook specialization obtained by taking every `E i = ℝ`. This
item therefore records only the singleton rewrite on that owner surface and does not introduce a
parallel single-valued proximal-map API. As in Theorem 6.6, the no-`⊥` hypothesis is essential:
without it, one coordinate summand can force the summed proximal objective to `⊥` while leaving
the other coordinates unconstrained, so the product proximal set need not be a singleton even when
the coordinatewise singleton statement is written down. -/

-- Proof sketch: rewrite `prox[separableSum f] x` using the owner theorem
-- `prox_separableSum_eq_coordinatewise`. The forward direction updates a single coordinate of `y`
-- and uses singletonity of the product proximal set to recover equality in that coordinate; the
-- reverse direction is extensionality on `PiLp`.
/-- Remark 6.7: for a separable function on a finite `L²` product, the set-valued proximal
identity from Theorem 6.6 is equivalent to the singleton statement that the proximal point at `x`
is the point whose `i`-th coordinate is the proximal point of the `i`-th summand `f i` at `x i`.
Specializing to `E i = ℝ`, this gives the textbook vector formula on `EuclideanSpace ℝ ι`, and
for `ι = Fin n` it is `prox_f(x) = (prox_{f_i}(x_i))_{i=1}^n`. -/
