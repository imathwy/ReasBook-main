/- Proposition 6.2.1 is `source-facing` in the Chapter 6 proximal-operator API. Domain sampling in
the minimal closure identifies the owner abstractions already upstream:

- `prox[...]` and `proximal_objective` from Definition 6.1 as the `core/canonical` owners,
- `mem_proximal_mapping_iff` as the canonical minimizer-set view,
- `prox_add_const` as the owner-level theorem showing additive real constants are derived data for
  proximal mappings.

The public source-facing data are only the constant value `c` and the base point `x`. The
zero-objective computation is the canonical special case of that source-facing statement, so it
should appear as a small companion theorem rather than as a parallel wrapper API. -/

-- Proof sketch: rewrite proximal membership for the zero function as global minimality of the
-- quadratic term. Evaluating at `x` forces the quadratic value at `u` to vanish, hence `u = x`;
-- conversely, the quadratic term is always nonnegative, so `x` is a minimizer.
/-- The proximal mapping of the zero function is the singleton containing the base point. -/

-- Proof sketch: remove the additive constant from the objective via the owner theorem
-- `prox_add_const`, then apply the zero-function computation above.
/-- Proposition 6.2.1: if `f` is the constant function with value `c`, then the proximal mapping
at `x` is the singleton `{x}`. Equivalently, the proximal operator of a constant function is the
identity map. -/
