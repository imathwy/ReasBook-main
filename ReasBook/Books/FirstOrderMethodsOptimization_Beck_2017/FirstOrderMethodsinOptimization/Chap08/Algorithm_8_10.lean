/- Algorithm 8.10 is `source-facing`: the textbook specifies the stochastic projected subgradient
iteration itself, not a packaged stochastic oracle. The canonical owner for the projection step is
the chapter map `metricProjection`, while the stochastic direction choice is most naturally modeled
pathwise by an `E`-valued sample rule `g : ℕ → C → Ω → E`. This keeps the public API on the
iterate sequence and avoids a noncanonical wrapper around the randomness. -/

/-- Algorithm 8.10: for a nonempty closed convex feasible set `C`, a feasible initial point `x0`,
stepsizes `t_k`, and a sample-indexed direction rule `g`, the stochastic projected subgradient
method generates the pathwise iterate sequence
`x^{k+1}(ω) = P_C (x^k(ω) - t_k g_k(x^k(ω), ω))`. -/

point at every sample `ω`. -/

current sample iterate minus the current stepsize times the sampled direction. -/
