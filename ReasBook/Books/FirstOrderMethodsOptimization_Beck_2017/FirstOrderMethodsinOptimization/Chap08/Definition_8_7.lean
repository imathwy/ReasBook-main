/- Definition 8.7 is `source-facing`: the textbook introduces a deterministic rule that chooses,
for each feasible point `x ∈ C`, one member of the owner set `extendedRealSubdifferential f x = ∂ f(x)`.
This is genuine data, not merely an existence claim, so the public API is a function on `C`
equipped with the pointwise membership property, without any existential wrapper or separate choice
operator. -/

/-- Definition 8.7: a subgradient selection for `f` on `C` is a deterministic rule assigning to
each `x ∈ C` a chosen subgradient `f'(x) ∈ ∂ f(x)`, that is, a function `C → E*` whose value at
every feasible point belongs to the extendedRealSubdifferential of `f` at that point. -/
structure SubgradientSelection (f : E → EReal) (C : Set E) where
  toFun : C → Module.Dual ℝ E
  mem_subdifferential : ∀ x : C, toFun x ∈ extendedRealSubdifferential f x.1

/-- A subgradient selection is canonically used as the underlying function `C → E*`. -/
