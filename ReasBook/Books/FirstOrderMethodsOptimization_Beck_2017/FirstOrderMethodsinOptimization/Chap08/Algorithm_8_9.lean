/- Algorithm 8.9 is `source-facing` in the linear convex-feasibility API. As in Algorithm 8.6,
the canonical owner is the recursive iterate sequence itself, while the maximizing-row condition
is recorded separately as an admissibility predicate on the row-selection rule rather than hidden
behind a noncanonical argmax choice. The ambient space is kept in the coordinate model
`Fin n → ℝ`, since the source item simultaneously uses row inner products `aᵢᵀ x` and the
coordinatewise positive part `[x]_+ = x⁺`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `normalized_row_residual`; it is definitionally the normalized absolute
-- affine-row violation `|a_jᵀ x - b_j| / ‖a_j‖`.
/-- Evaluating `normalized_row_residual` gives the normalized absolute violation
`|a_jᵀ x - b_j| / ‖a_j‖`. -/

  -- Unfolding the residual definition exposes the normalized affine-row violation verbatim.

/-- Algorithm 8.9: given affine rows `a_iᵀ x = b_i`, an initial point `x0`, and a rule choosing
at each iterate a row with maximal normalized residual, the greedy linear-feasibility projection
method updates `x^k` either by the orthogonal correction onto the selected row hyperplane or by
the positive part `x⁺ = [x]_+`, according to which correction is farther from the current
iterate. -/
