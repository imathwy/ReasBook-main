/- Definition 7.1 is `source-facing`: it records invariance of a proper extended-real-valued
function under a chosen family of orthogonal symmetries of `ℝ^ι`. The `core/canonical` owner for
those symmetries in mathlib and this project is `Matrix.orthogonalGroup ι ℝ`, and the action on
`ι → ℝ` is the inherited matrix action. Primitive data are therefore just properness together with
invariance under every matrix in the chosen family. -/

/-- Definition 7.1: a proper extended-real-valued function on `ι → ℝ` is symmetric with respect to
a family `𝒜` of orthogonal matrices if it is invariant under the action of every element of `𝒜`. -/

  map_smul (A : Matrix.orthogonalGroup ι ℝ) (hA : A ∈ 𝒜) (x : ι → ℝ) :
    f (A • x) = f x
