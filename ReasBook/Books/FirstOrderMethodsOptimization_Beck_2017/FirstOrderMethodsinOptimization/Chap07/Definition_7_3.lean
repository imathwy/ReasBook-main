/- Definition 7.3 is `source-facing`: the textbook property is invariance under coordinatewise
absolute value on `ℝ^n`, here expressed on the canonical owner space `ι → ℝ` and specializing to
`ℝ^n` when `ι = Fin n`. The primitive data are just that invariance identity. The canonical
bridge/view toward the nonnegative cone is the coordinatewise map
`nnabs : (ι → ℝ) → (ι → ℝ≥0)`, and factorization through that map is derived API rather than
primitive data. -/

/-- The coordinatewise map from `ι → ℝ` to `ι → ℝ≥0` obtained by taking absolute values. When
`ι = Fin n`, this is the usual map from `ℝ^n` to the nonnegative orthant. -/
def nnabs (x : ι → ℝ) : ι → NNReal :=
  Real.nnabs ∘ x

/-- Definition 7.3: an extended-real-valued function on `ι → ℝ` is absolutely symmetric when it
depends only on the coordinatewise absolute values of its input, equivalently when `f x = f (|x|)`
for every `x`. For `ι = Fin n`, this is the textbook notion on `ℝⁿ`. -/

/-- Coercing `nnabs x` back to `ι → ℝ` recovers the coordinatewise absolute-value function `|x|`.
When `ι = Fin n`, this is the absolute-value vector in `ℝ^n`. -/

`nnabs`. -/

-- Proof sketch: if `f` is absolutely symmetric, define `g` on `ι → ℝ≥0` by restricting `f` along
-- the coercion `(ι → NNReal) → (ι → ℝ)`. Conversely, if `f` factors through `nnabs`,
-- then `f x` depends only on `|x|`.
/-- An extended-real-valued function on `ι → ℝ` is absolutely symmetric exactly when it factors
through the coordinatewise absolute-value map into `ι → ℝ≥0`. For `ι = Fin n`, this recovers the
factorization through the nonnegative orthant `ℝ_+^n`. -/
