variable (f : E → ℝ) (Lf : NNReal)

/- Definition 10.4.1 is a recall-only `source-facing` item in the smooth whole-space
minimization domain: it introduces no new owner abstraction beyond the Chapter 8 unconstrained
minimization owner and the Chapter 5 smoothness owner.

Domain sampling:
- `unconstrained_problem_solutions` is the source-facing owner for minimizing `f` on the ambient
  space `E`;
- `mem_unconstrained_problem_solutions_iff` is the companion characterization by `IsMinOn f
  Set.univ x`;
- `is_l_smooth_on` is the Chapter 5 owner for the `L_f`-smoothness clause;
- `is_l_smooth_on_iff` is the derivative-Lipschitz companion API for that smoothness owner.

The primitive data are only the objective `f : E → ℝ` and the smoothness parameter `L_f`. The
source-facing whole-space problem and smoothness clause are therefore the canonical specializations
`unconstrained_problem_solutions f` and `is_l_smooth_on f Set.univ Lf`, derived directly from the
existing owners rather than from a parallel local wrapper. -/
