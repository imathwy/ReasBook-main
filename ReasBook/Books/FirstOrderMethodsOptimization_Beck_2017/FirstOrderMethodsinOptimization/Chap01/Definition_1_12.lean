/- Definition 1.12: the closed line segment between two points in a real vector space is the
canonical mathlib set `segment ℝ x y`; the companion declarations below record the textbook
one-parameter formulas for the closed and open line segments. -/
#check (segment ℝ)

-- Proof sketch: use `segment_eq_image`; then unpack membership in the image of `Icc (0 : ℝ) 1`
-- and rewrite the affine combination to match the textbook coefficient convention.
/-- Companion characterization of membership in the closed line segment `segment ℝ x y` by the
textbook one-parameter formula. -/

/-- The textbook open line segment in a real vector space: it is obtained from the canonical
mathlib `openSegment ℝ x y` by removing the left endpoint, which changes only the diagonal case
`x = y`. -/
def openLineSegment (x y : E) : Set E :=
  openSegment ℝ x y \ {x}

-- Proof sketch: unfold `openLineSegment`; when `x ≠ y`, mathlib already knows that `x` is not in
-- `openSegment ℝ x y`, so removing `{x}` does nothing.
/-- When the endpoints are distinct, the textbook open line segment agrees with mathlib's
`openSegment`. -/

-- Proof sketch: combine `openLineSegment_eq_openSegment` with `openSegment_eq_image`; then
-- unpack membership in the image of `Ioo (0 : ℝ) 1` and rewrite the affine combination to match
-- the textbook coefficient convention.
/-- When the endpoints are distinct, membership in the textbook open line segment is given by the
one-parameter formula with parameter in `(0,1)`. -/
