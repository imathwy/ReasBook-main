/- Definition 9.5 is a `source-facing` specialization in the Chapter 9 mirror-descent API. The
`core/canonical` owner remains `IsBregmanPotentialOn`, but the textbook statement is not the bare
owner itself: it is the composite-model specialization obtained by instantiating the constraint set
to `dom(g) = effective_domain g`. The main entry should therefore present that specialized type
expression directly, rather than recalling the unspecialized owner name alone. -/

/- Definition 9.5: in the composite model, the standing assumptions on the mirror map `ω` are
exactly that `ω` is a Bregman potential on `dom(g) = effective_domain g` with modulus `σ`. -/
#check (IsBregmanPotentialOn ω (effective_domain g) σ)
