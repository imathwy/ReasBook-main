local notation "E" => EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)

/- Definition 10.53 is `bridge/view`. Domain sampling in the local smoothing API gives:
- `H[μ]` from Definition 6.8 as the source-facing owner for the Huber smoothing;
- `M[μ, f]` from Definition 6.7 as the canonical Moreau-envelope owner;
- `moreau_envelope_norm_penalty_toReal_eq_huber_function` from Example 6.54 as the existing
  bridge from the norm envelope to the Huber owner.

The primitive data already live upstream. The only local content is the Euclidean specialization
to `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` together with the textbook reading of `x ↦ ‖x‖` as `norm_penalty 1`.
The explicit piecewise formula is therefore derived API via `huber_function_apply`, and the
Chapter 10 item itself is only the Euclidean specialization of the existing Chapter 6 bridge, so
the main entry here should be direct reuse of that theorem rather than a parallel local alias. -/
recall huber_function

/- Definition 10.53: on `ℝ^n`, the real-valued Moreau envelope of the Euclidean norm agrees
with the canonical Huber function `H[μ]`. This is exactly the Chapter 6 bridge theorem specialized
to `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. -/
