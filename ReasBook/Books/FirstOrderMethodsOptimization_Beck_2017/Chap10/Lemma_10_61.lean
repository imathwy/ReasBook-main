/-- The set `Λ_a` of primal counterparts of a dual vector `a`: the unit-ball points where the
pairing with `a` attains the operator norm. This is equivalent to the source's zero/nonzero
case split, but keeps only the canonical primitive data on the continuous dual. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `primalCounterparts`, rewrite unit-ball membership as `mem_closedBall`,
-- and express the maximizer condition by `isMaxOn_iff`. The forward implication uses the operator
-- norm bound `a v ≤ ‖a‖` on the closed unit ball. For the converse, the maximality hypothesis on
-- `aDagger` bounds `a` on every normalized vector and therefore forces `‖a‖ ≤ a aDagger`.
/-- A vector belongs to `Λ[a]` exactly when it lies in the closed unit ball and maximizes `a`
over that ball. -/
