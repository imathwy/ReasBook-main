/- Definition 10.64 is `source-facing`: it identifies the chapter owner
`Λ[a] : Set E` with the extendedRealSubdifferential of the continuous-dual norm at the
dual vector `a`. Domain sampling for the surrounding convex-analysis API gives:
- `Λ[·]` from Lemma 10.61 as the source-facing owner object;
- `subdifferentialAt` from Theorem 3.4 as the `core/canonical` extendedRealSubdifferential owner;
- `NormedSpace.inclusionInDoubleDual ℝ E` as the canonical `bridge/view` from primal vectors to the
  bidual-valued strong-dual subgradients of the continuous-dual norm.

The primitive data are only the dual vector `a`. The primal set `Λ[a]` should therefore remain the
public source-facing object, while the strong-dual extendedRealSubdifferential is used through this canonical
bridge instead of replacing `Λ[a]` by a second owner living on the bidual. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `Λ[a]` using Lemma 10.61. For `x : E`, membership in the transported
-- strong-dual extendedRealSubdifferential says that the bidual evaluation functional
-- `NormedSpace.inclusionInDoubleDual ℝ E x`, i.e. `b ↦ b x`, satisfies the subgradient inequality
-- for `h(a) = ‖a‖` at `a`. Evaluating that inequality at `0` yields `‖x‖ ≤ 1`, while
-- evaluating it along positive multiples of `a` yields `a x = ‖a‖`; conversely these two
-- conditions imply the subgradient inequality by the dual-pairing bound
-- `b x ≤ ‖b‖ ‖x‖ ≤ ‖b‖`.
/-- Helper for Definition 10.64: membership of the bidual evaluation functional in the norm
extendedRealSubdifferential is exactly the pointwise subgradient inequality `‖b‖ ≥ ‖a‖ + (b - a)(x)`. -/
