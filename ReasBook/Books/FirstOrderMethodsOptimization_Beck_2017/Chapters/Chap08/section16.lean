/- Definition 8.16 is `source-facing`: the textbook introduces the constrained finite-sum model
`min {∑ᵢ fᵢ(x) : x ∈ C}` used by the incremental projected subgradient method. The genuinely new
mathematical object here is the aggregate objective `x ↦ ∑ i, f i x`, while the optimization
viewpoint is canonically expressed in mathlib through `IsMinOn` for the chosen feasible set `C`.
The public owner is therefore the aggregate objective, with a companion bridge to the minimization
predicate. -/

/-- Definition 8.16: the incremental projected subgradient problem uses the aggregate objective
obtained by summing the component functions `f i`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold `finite_sum_objective`; evaluation at `x` is definitionally the finite sum

variable {α : Type u} [PseudoMetricSpace α]

/- Theorem 8.16 is `source-facing`: it is about convergence of a sequence under the Chapter 8
Fejér-monotonicity condition, while the canonical mathlib notion for a "limit point of a
sequence" is `MapClusterPt _ atTop x`. The source proof uses an already existing limit point, so
that hidden dependency is made explicit rather than being buried in a surrogate boundedness
package. -/

-- Proof sketch: choose a sequential cluster point `y` of `x`; the subset hypothesis puts `y` in
-- `S`, so Fejér monotonicity makes `n ↦ dist (x n) y` antitone. Extract a subsequence converging to
-- `y` from the cluster-point hypothesis; along that subsequence the distance to `y` tends to `0`.
-- An antitone nonnegative real sequence with a subsequence tending to `0` must itself tend to `0`,
-- hence `x` tends to `y`.
/-- Helper for Theorem 8.16: fixing a point of `S` turns the Fejér inequalities into an antitone
distance profile. -/
