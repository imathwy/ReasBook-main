/-! ### Definition_1_24 (from Chap01) -/
section

variable {ι : Type*}

/- Definition 1.24 is `source-facing`: it introduces the coordinate box owner `Box[ℓ,u]` with
extended-real endpoints. The textbook box in `ℝ^n` with finite real bounds is the specialization
of this owner obtained by coercing the endpoints to `EReal`, and that specialization agrees with
the pointwise interval `Set.Icc`. -/

/-- The coordinate box in `ι → ℝ` with extended-real lower and upper bounds. -/
def box (ℓ u : ι → EReal) : Set (ι → ℝ) :=
  {x | ∀ i, ℓ i ≤ (x i : EReal) ∧ (x i : EReal) ≤ u i}

notation "Box[" ℓ "," u "]" => box ℓ u

-- Proof sketch: unfold `Box[ℓ,u]`; membership is definitionally the coordinatewise bound
-- condition.
/-- A point lies in `Box[ℓ,u]` exactly when each coordinate lies between the corresponding
extended-real lower and upper bounds. -/
@[simp] theorem mem_box_iff {ℓ u : ι → EReal} {x : ι → ℝ} :
    x ∈ Box[ℓ,u] ↔ ∀ i, ℓ i ≤ (x i : EReal) ∧ (x i : EReal) ≤ u i :=
  Iff.rfl

-- Proof sketch: `Box[ℓ,u]` is the product of the closed coordinate intervals
-- `((↑) : ℝ → EReal) ⁻¹' Set.Icc (ℓ i) (u i)`, so closedness follows from
-- `isClosed_Icc`, continuity of the coercion `ℝ → EReal`, and `isClosed_set_pi`.
/-- The coordinate box `Box[ℓ,u]` is closed in the product coordinate space `ι → ℝ`. -/

-- Proof sketch: both sides express the same pointwise inequalities on `ι → ℝ`; rewrite
-- `Set.Icc` using the product order and simplify the endpoint coercions to `EReal`.
