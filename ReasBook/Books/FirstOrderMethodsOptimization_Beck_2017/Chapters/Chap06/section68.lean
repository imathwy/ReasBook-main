/- Lemma 6.68 is `source-facing`: its owner is still the Chapter 6 proximal mapping `prox[...]`.
The mandatory domain sampling points to the following upstream owner abstractions.

1. `prox[...]` from Definition 6.1 is the chapter-level `core/canonical` proximal owner.
2. `ContinuousLinearMap.adjoint` with the scoped notation `†`, together with
   `ContinuousLinearMap.inverse` and `ContinuousLinearMap.IsInvertible`, is the canonical
   operator-theoretic owner surface in mathlib for the Gram operator `A A†`.
3. `proximal_mapping_precompose_continuousAffineMap` from Theorem 6.15 shows that this chapter's
   proximal transport API is organized around continuous linear or affine maps rather than
   coordinate models.
4. `norm_penalty` and `prox_norm_penalty_eq_singleton_shrinkage` from Example 6.19 identify the
   target-space penalty owner and its canonical proximal singleton formula.

Primitive data split by layer.
- `source-facing`: the continuous linear map `A`, the scalar `lam`, the base point `x`, and,
  when the textbook branch test is stated, the full-row-rank hypothesis on `A A†`.
- `bridge/view`: on the active branch, the proximal singleton formula only depends on a positive
  shift `α` satisfying `‖(A A† + α I)⁻¹ (A x)‖ = λ`; the global invertibility assumption belongs
  upstream in the existence theorem for that shift, not in the singleton formula itself.

The previous file stored a globally chosen shift as primitive public data. That was the wrong
layer: the positive multiplier only has mathematical meaning on the active branch. The refined API
keeps that multiplier branch-local through an existence/uniqueness theorem and a companion
proximal formula parameterized by any positive root. -/

-- Proof sketch: solve the proximal optimality system for `u ↦ λ ‖A u‖ + (1 / 2) ‖u - x‖²`.
-- On the active branch, any positive root `α` of `‖(A A† + α I)⁻¹ (A x)‖ = λ` produces the
-- proximal point `x - A† (A A† + α I)⁻¹ (A x)`. Combined with
-- `existsUnique_linear_image_norm_prox_shift`, this recovers the textbook unique active-branch
-- formula without introducing a global choice operator into the public API.
/-- Lemma 6.68, active branch proximal formula: if an explicit positive shift `α` satisfies
`‖(A A† + α I)⁻¹ (A x)‖ = λ`, then the proximal set of `norm_penalty lam ∘ A` at `x` is the
singleton `{x - A† (A A† + α I)⁻¹ (A x)}`. Together with
`existsUnique_linear_image_norm_prox_shift`, this is the canonical branch-local replacement for
the old piecewise formula with a globally chosen shift; the global full-row-rank assumption is
needed for existence of such an `α`, not for this branch-local singleton identity itself. -/
