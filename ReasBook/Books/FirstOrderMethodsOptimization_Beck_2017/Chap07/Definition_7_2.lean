-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 7.2 is recall-only in the Chapter 7 symmetry API. The `core/canonical` owner
abstraction is mathlib's `Function.Even`; the textbook identity `f x = f (-x)` is a thin
`bridge/view` reformulation of that owner, not a second definition. -/
recall Function.Even

/-- Evenness of an extended-real-valued function on `ℝⁿ` is exactly the textbook identity
`f x = f (-x)` for every `x`. -/
