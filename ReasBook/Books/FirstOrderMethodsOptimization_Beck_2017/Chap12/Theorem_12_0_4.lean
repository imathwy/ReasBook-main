/- Theorem 12.0.4 is `source-facing`: the textbook object is the partial-sum sequence
`s_m = ∑_{n=1}^m 1 / n^2`. Domain sampling shows that the owner abstraction is the chapter's
summability theorem `one_div_nat_sq_summable_from_one`, together with mathlib's canonical
derived API `Summable.hasSum`, `HasSum.tendsto_sum_nat`, and
`CauchySeq.isBounded_range`. The primitive data are only the summable sequence
`n ↦ 1 / ((n + 1 : ℕ) : ℝ)^2`; boundedness of its partial sums is derived API. -/
