/- Proposition 12.0.2 is a `bridge/view` item: the source-facing series starts at `n = 1`,
while the core owner abstraction is the mathlib `p`-series theorem
`Real.summable_one_div_nat_pow`, stated on `n : ℕ` starting at `0`. The proposition is the
canonical shift-by-one specialization of that owner. -/
