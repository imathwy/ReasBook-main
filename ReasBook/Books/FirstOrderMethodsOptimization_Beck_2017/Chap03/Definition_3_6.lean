/- Definition 3.6 is `source-facing` in the chapter subgradient API. The primitive owner object is
the pointwise set `extendedRealSubdifferential f x`; Definition 3.5 already identifies "subdifferentiable at
`x`" with the canonical proposition `(extendedRealSubdifferential f x).Nonempty`. This file therefore keeps
only the textbook point-domain `dom(∂ f)` together with the atomic membership and domain
consequence lemmas derived from that owner set. -/

/-- Definition 3.6: the domain of the extendedRealSubdifferential `dom(∂ f)` is the set of points where the
extended-real-valued function `f` is subdifferentiable, equivalently where `∂ f(x)` is nonempty. -/
def subdifferential_domain (f : E → EReal) : Set E :=
  {x | (extendedRealSubdifferential f x).Nonempty}

-- Proof sketch: unfold `subdifferential_domain`.
/-- Membership in `dom(∂ f)` means that the extendedRealSubdifferential at the point is nonempty. -/
@[simp] theorem mem_subdifferential_domain {f : E → EReal} {x : E} :
    x ∈ subdifferential_domain f ↔ (extendedRealSubdifferential f x).Nonempty :=
  Iff.rfl

-- Proof sketch: if `x ∉ effective_domain f`, then Definition 3.2 gives
-- `extendedRealSubdifferential f x = ∅`, so `x` cannot belong to `subdifferential_domain f`.
/-- Every point in the domain of the extendedRealSubdifferential belongs to the effective domain. -/
