/-- Definition 3.10: an extended-real-valued function is differentiable at `x` when `x` lies in
the interior of its finite domain and the real-valued restriction `y ↦ (f y).toReal` is
differentiable there. -/
def is_differentiable_at (f : E → EReal) (x : E) : Prop :=
  x ∈ interior (finite_domain f) ∧
    DifferentiableAt ℝ (fun y ↦ (f y).toReal) x

-- Proof sketch: Fréchet differentiability of `y ↦ (f y).toReal` is, by definition, existence of a
-- continuous linear derivative. The chapter-specific content is only the common hypothesis
-- `x ∈ interior (finite_domain f)`, so the witness theorem should expose the owner predicate
-- `HasFDerivAt` directly rather than a parallel local wrapper.
/-- A function is differentiable at `x` exactly when its real-valued restriction has a Fréchet
derivative there, together with the finite-domain interior condition from Definition 3.10. -/
