variable {E : Type u} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]

/- Theorem 3.1 is a `bridge/view` item in the chapter subdifferential API. The owner declaration
is `subdifferential : Set (Module.Dual ℝ E)` from Definition 3.2, while the closedness statement
in this theorem lives on the topologized continuous-dual view. Owner-level convexity already lives
in `convex_subdifferential`, so the only primitive
data here is the canonical preimage of `subdifferential` along
`StrongDual ℝ E → Module.Dual ℝ E`; membership lemmas are derived API. -/
