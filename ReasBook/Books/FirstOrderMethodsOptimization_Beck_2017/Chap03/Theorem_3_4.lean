variable {E : Type u} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]

/- Theorem 3.4 is `source-facing` in the chapter real-valued convex-analysis API. The
`core/canonical` owner notions are Chapter 3's `subdifferential` and `strongDualSubdifferential`;
the declaration `subdifferentialAt` below is the stable real-valued specialization used
throughout the chapter, not a second owner abstraction. -/
/-- The real-valued subdifferential at `x`, viewed through the chapter's strong-dual bridge for
the extended-real-valued coercion of `f`. -/
abbrev subdifferentialAt (f : E → ℝ) (x : E) : Set (StrongDual ℝ E) :=

variable {E : Type u} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]

-- Proof sketch: view `f` as the everywhere-finite extended-real-valued function
-- `y ↦ (f y : EReal)`. Its effective domain is all of `E`, so every `x` is an interior point.
-- The owner theorem `subdifferential_nonempty_at_interior_point` yields an algebraic dual
-- subgradient, and finite dimensionality upgrades that linear functional canonically to a
-- continuous one via `LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap`; this is exactly a point of
-- `subdifferentialAt f x`.
/-- Theorem 3.4 in owner-set form: every real-valued convex function on `E` is subdifferentiable
at each point. -/

variable {E : Type u} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]

/-- The Euclidean/vector-side subdifferential at `x`, obtained by transporting the owner
`subdifferentialAt f x : Set (StrongDual ℝ E)` back to vectors using the Riesz map `toDualMap`.
This is a derived `bridge/view` API obtained by specializing `euclideanSubdifferential` to the
everywhere-finite coercion of `f`; `subdifferentialAt` remains the owner abstraction. -/
