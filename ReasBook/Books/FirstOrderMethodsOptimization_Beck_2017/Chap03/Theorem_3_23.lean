This item is `source-facing` at the Chapter 3 owner `subdifferential`. Domain sampling for the
weak max-rule API points to the following declarations:

* `is_subgradient_at` in `Definition_3_1` as the primitive predicate.
* `subdifferential` in `Definition_3_2` as the owner set-valued map.
* `convex_subdifferential` in `Definition_3_2` as the owner-level derived convexity needed to pass
  from the active union to its convex hull.
* `directional_derivative_iSup_eq_iSup_active_indices` in `Theorem_3_9` as the matching canonical
  active-index subtype for pointwise suprema.

The primitive data here is only the ambient subdifferential of the pointwise maximum; the active
index collection at `x` is derived data, so the public statement uses the canonical active-index
subtype directly rather than a separate wrapper owner. The theorem stays directly on the owner
declaration from `Definition_3_2` rather than depending on the later strong-dual bridge/view
files. Semantic recall via `lean_leansearch` did not expose a direct mathlib weak-max
subdifferential theorem, so the source-facing owner statement stays chapter-local; the canonical
Lean surface keeps only the genuinely used pointwise upper-bound hypothesis, because the active
index equality already identifies the branch value at `x` and `convex_subdifferential` already
provides the convex target needed for the convex-hull conclusion.

-- Proof sketch: if `g ∈ ∂ fᵢ(x)` and `i` is active at `x`, then for every `y` we have
-- `F y ≥ f i y ≥ f i x + g (y - x) = F x + g (y - x)`, so `g ∈ ∂ F(x)`. Hence the union of the
-- active subdifferentials is contained in the ambient subdifferential. Since `∂ F(x)` is convex
-- by `convex_subdifferential`, the convex hull of that union is contained there as well.
/-- Theorem 3.23: weak maximum rule of subdifferential calculus. If every branch `fᵢ` lies below
