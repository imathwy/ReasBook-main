/- Definition 8.4 is `source-facing`: the textbook introduces the admissible stepsizes obtained by
minimizing the one-dimensional restriction of `f` along the negative gradient direction at the
current iterate. Domain sampling shows that the `core/canonical` minimizer owner is mathlib's
`IsMinOn` on the feasible ray `Set.Ici 0`, while the chapter already uses the ambient gradient
notation `∇`. The public API therefore packages exact line search as the set of nonnegative
minimizers of that line-search objective, with no extra argmin wrapper structure. -/

/-- Definition 8.4: the exact line search stepsizes at the current iterate `x` are the
nonnegative scalars that minimize the one-dimensional descent objective
`t ↦ f (x - t • ∇ f x)` over all `t ≥ 0`. -/

  {t | t ∈ Set.Ici (0 : ℝ) ∧ IsMinOn (fun s ↦ f (x - s • ∇ f x)) (Set.Ici 0) t}

-- Proof sketch: unfold `exact_line_search_stepsizes`; membership is definitionally the conjunction
-- that `t` is feasible (`t ≥ 0`) and that it minimizes the line-search objective on the feasible
-- ray `Set.Ici 0`.
/-- A scalar belongs to `exact_line_search_stepsizes f x` exactly when it is nonnegative and
minimizes `t ↦ f (x - t • ∇ f x)` over all nonnegative step sizes. -/
