variable {E : Type u} {m : ℕ}

/- Definition 8.17 is `source-facing`: it fixes the primal inequality-constrained optimization
problem with ambient set constraint `x ∈ X` and coordinatewise inequality constraint `g(x) ≤ 0`.
The canonical owner abstraction for optimality itself is mathlib's `IsMinOn`; the genuinely new
data here is the feasible set obtained by combining `X` with the coordinatewise inequalities. -/

/-- Definition 8.17: the feasible set of the problem `min f(x)` subject to `g(x) ≤ 0` and
`x ∈ X` consists of the points of `X` satisfying every coordinatewise inequality constraint
`g x i ≤ 0`. -/
def inequality_constrained_primal_feasible_set
    (X : Set E) (g : E → Fin m → ℝ) : Set E :=
  {x | x ∈ X ∧ ∀ i : Fin m, g x i ≤ 0}

-- Proof sketch: unfold `inequality_constrained_primal_feasible_set`; membership is exactly the
-- conjunction of `x ∈ X` and the coordinatewise inequalities `g x i ≤ 0`.
/-- Helper for Definition 8.17: membership in
`inequality_constrained_primal_feasible_set X g` means belonging to `X` and satisfying all
inequalities `g x i ≤ 0`. -/

  -- Unfolding the set-builder exposes exactly the ambient-set and inequality constraints.

variable {α : Type v} [Preorder α]

-- Proof sketch: `IsMinOn` only records the comparison inequalities on feasible points, so the
-- minimizer's own feasibility must be bundled separately to match the textbook constrained
-- problem statement.
/-- Helper for Definition 8.17: a feasible point `x` minimizes `f` on
`inequality_constrained_primal_feasible_set X g` exactly when `x` satisfies the inequality
constraints and beats every other feasible comparison point. -/
theorem isMinOn_inequality_constrained_primal_feasible_set_iff
    {f : E → α} {X : Set E} {g : E → Fin m → ℝ} {x : E} :

  -- Route correction: mathlib's `IsMinOn` does not assert `x ∈ s`, so we keep feasibility
  -- explicit on the left-hand side before rewriting into the textbook constrained form.
