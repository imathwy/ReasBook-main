/- Algorithm 8.2 is `source-facing` in the chapter descent-method API. Because the algorithm
allows an arbitrary subgradient choice at each iterate, the recursive owner below is the iterate
sequence generated from an index-dependent direction-selection rule `g : ℕ → E → E`; the source
conditions that these selected directions satisfy the Euclidean subgradient inequality at the
current iterate and that the stepsizes are positive are recorded separately by an admissibility
predicate. -/

/-- Algorithm 8.2: given an initial point `x0`, step sizes `t_k`, and an index-dependent rule `g`
that selects the current direction from the current iterate, the subgradient method generates the
iterates by the update `x^{k+1} = x^k - t_k g_k(x^k)`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unfold the recursive definition of `subgradient_method` at `k + 1`.
/-- One step of the subgradient method subtracts the current stepsize times the selected current
direction. -/
