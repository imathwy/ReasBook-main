/-- Theorem 8.17.1: if the previously established projected-subgradient bound
`f_best - f_opt ≤ L_f d_{X^*}(x^0) / √(k + 1)` holds, then the sufficient condition
`L_f d_{X^*}(x^0) / √(k + 1) ≤ ε` implies `f_best - f_opt ≤ ε`. In particular, this yields the
usual `O(ε⁻²)` iteration estimate through the companion iteration-count inequality. -/
