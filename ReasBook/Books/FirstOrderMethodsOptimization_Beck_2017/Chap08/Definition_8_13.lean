/- Definition 8.13 is `source-facing`: the textbook reformulates the feasibility problem for a
finite family of sets through the finite maximum of the point-to-set distances. The canonical
owners are therefore `Metric.infDist` for distance to a set, `Finset.sup'` for the finite maximum,
and mathlib's `IsMinOn` for the minimization viewpoint. The convexity hypotheses from the textbook
do not affect this metric formulation itself, so they are omitted from the owner and left for
later algorithmic results. -/

`S i` can be reformulated through the max-distance objective

-- Proof sketch: if `x ∈ ⋂ i, S i`, then every distance term is zero, so the objective value is
-- zero and hence minimal because each `Metric.infDist` is nonnegative. Conversely, if `x`
-- globally minimizes the objective, compare it with a feasible point from `hinter` to see that
-- the minimum value is zero. Then each distance term vanishes, and closedness together with the
-- nonemptiness inherited from `hinter` implies `x ∈ S i` for every `i`.
/-- The max-distance formulation has the same global minimizers as the original feasibility
problem: under closedness and nonempty intersection, a point minimizes the objective exactly when
it lies in `⋂ i, S i`. -/
