-- Proof sketch: if `a ≠ ⊤` and `f x ≤ a`, then automatically `f x < ⊤`, so every `Iic a`
-- sublevel set lies in the effective domain.

-- Proof sketch: prove lower semicontinuity pointwise. On the closed effective domain, continuity
-- gives lower semicontinuity within the domain. Outside the domain the function is identically
-- `⊤` on an open neighborhood, because the complement of a closed effective domain is open.
-- Combine these two cases to obtain lower semicontinuity everywhere.
/-- Theorem 2.3: if an extended-real-valued function is continuous on its effective domain and that
domain is closed, then the function is closed, equivalently lower semicontinuous. -/
