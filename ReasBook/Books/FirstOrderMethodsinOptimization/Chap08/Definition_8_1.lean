variable {E : Type u} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]

/- Definition 8.1: in this chapter, an abstract Euclidean space is modeled by the canonical real
inner-product-space owner `InnerProductSpace ℝ E`; the finite-dimensionality hypothesis and the
derived Euclidean norm formula are recalled below as companion views. -/
#check InnerProductSpace ℝ E

/- Finite-dimensionality is the remaining Euclidean-space hypothesis, encoded by the canonical
typeclass `FiniteDimensional ℝ E`. -/
#check FiniteDimensional ℝ E

/- The Euclidean norm is canonically derived from the ambient real inner product, identified with
`√⟪x, x⟫_ℝ` by `norm_eq_sqrt_real_inner`. -/
#check norm_eq_sqrt_real_inner
