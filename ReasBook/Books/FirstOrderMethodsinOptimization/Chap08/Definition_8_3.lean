/- Definition 8.3 is `source-facing` at the standard right-limit owner data
`Tendsto (𝓝[>] 0)`. In this item-file setting the notion is stated directly in those canonical
terms, rather than through an extra wrapper around auxiliary data. -/

/-- Definition 8.3: a nonzero vector `d` is a descent direction of `f` at `x` when the
directional derivative of `f` at `x` along `d` exists and is strictly negative. -/
def is_descent_direction_at (f : E → EReal) (x d : E) : Prop :=
  d ≠ 0 ∧
    ∃ ℓ : EReal,
      Tendsto (fun α : ℝ ↦ (f (x + α • d) - f x) / (α : EReal)) (𝓝[>] (0 : ℝ)) (𝓝 ℓ) ∧

-- Proof sketch: unfold `is_descent_direction_at`; the statement is exactly the defining
-- right-limit characterization of a descent direction.
/-- A descent direction is equivalently a nonzero direction admitting a negative right-limit for
the directional difference quotient. -/
