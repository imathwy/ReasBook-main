Definition 3.20 is `source-facing`. The ambient domain is finite-family inequality-constrained
optimization, and the owner abstractions for later KKT/Fritz-John developments are the chapter
feasible-set owner `inequality_feasible_set` together with the strict feasible set cut out by the
same constraint family. The primitive data are only the constraint family `g`; Slater's condition
is derived from the strict feasible-set owner as its nonemptiness. -/

/-- The strict feasible set of the inequality-constrained problem cut out by the family `g`. -/

/-- Membership in `strict_inequality_feasible_set g` means satisfying every inequality
constraint strictly. -/

/-- Every strict feasible point is feasible for the inequality-constrained problem. -/
theorem strict_inequality_feasible_set_subset_inequality_feasible_set :
    strict_inequality_feasible_set g ⊆ inequality_feasible_set g := fun _ hx i ↦
  le_of_lt (hx i)

/-- Definition 3.20: Slater's condition for the inequality-constrained problem with constraint
family `g` means that there exists a point strictly satisfying every inequality `g_i(x) < 0`. -/

/-- Slater's condition holds exactly when some point satisfies every inequality constraint
strictly. -/
