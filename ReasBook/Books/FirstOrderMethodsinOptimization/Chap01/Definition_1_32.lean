/- Definition 1.32: The set of all `n × n` orthogonal real matrices is represented in mathlib by
`Matrix.orthogonalGroup`; for matrices indexed by `Fin n`, this is `Matrix.orthogonalGroup (Fin n) ℝ`. -/
recall Matrix.orthogonalGroup

/-- Membership in the orthogonal group is equivalent to satisfying both transpose-inverse equations. -/
-- Proof sketch: combine `Matrix.mem_orthogonalGroup_iff` and
-- `Matrix.mem_orthogonalGroup_iff'`, which separately identify membership with the two matrix
-- inverse identities.
