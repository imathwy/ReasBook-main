-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

-- Domain sampling for this exercise:
-- * primary domain: finite-dimensional convex geometry / Helly's theorem
-- * source-facing chapter owner: `helly_theorem_empty_subfamily`
-- * core/canonical mathlib owner: `Convex.helly_theorem`
-- * primitive data: a finite family `F : Fin h → Set E` with the Helly cardinality bound,
--   convexity of each member, and empty total intersection
-- * derived API: a subfamily of cardinality `finrank 𝕜 E + 1` with empty intersection

Exercise 3.31. The exercise asks to recover the chapter's Helly theorem. That public
source-facing outcome is already the chapter owner `helly_theorem_empty_subfamily`; the mathlib
theorem `Convex.helly_theorem` is only supporting infrastructure for its proof. Accordingly this
exercise should recall the existing chapter statement rather than introduce a second
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`-specialized wrapper theorem.
