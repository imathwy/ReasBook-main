-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

-- Domain sampling for this exercise:
-- * primary domain: finite linear inequality/equality systems and Farkas-type multiplier
--   certificates
-- * source-facing chapter owner:
--   `mixed_linear_system_feasible_iff_nonnegative_multiplier_evaluation`
-- * supporting canonical theorem: `farkas_lemma_linear_inequalities`
-- * primitive data: the matrices `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and right-hand sides `f`, `g`
-- * derived API: the multiplier-side nonnegativity, annihilation, and evaluation conditions

/- Exercise 3.1. This exercise asks for a reproving of Theorem 3.6 via Farkas' Lemma. The public
mathematical content is already the chapter owner theorem
`mixed_linear_system_feasible_iff_nonnegative_multiplier_evaluation`; the Farkas-based proof route
is internal supporting provenance, not a second public theorem with a duplicate interface. -/
