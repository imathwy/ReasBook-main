-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

-- Domain sampling for this exercise:
-- * primary domain: Radon partitions for finite-dimensional convexity
-- * source-facing chapter owner: `radon_theorem`
-- * source-facing primitive data: an ambient set `S : Set E` with the Radon-cardinality bound
-- * core/canonical supporting theorem: `Convex.radon_partition`
-- * bridge inside the chapter proof: choose a finite subtype of `S`, apply the core partition
--   theorem there, then extend the resulting partition back to the ambient set

Exercise 3.30. This exercise asks for a proof of Theorem 3.43 using affine dependence. The
source-facing statement is Chapter 3's `radon_theorem`. The proof route goes through the
affine-dependent family theorem `Convex.radon_partition`, but that mathlib theorem is only
supporting provenance for the chapter statement rather than the public outcome of this exercise.
