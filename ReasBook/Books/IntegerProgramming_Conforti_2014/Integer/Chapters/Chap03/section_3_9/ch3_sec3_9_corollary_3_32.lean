/- Corollary 3.32 (1): if the mixed system `Aeq *ᵥ x = beq`, `Aineq *ᵥ x ≤ bineq` is a minimal
representation of its solution polyhedron, then `Aeq` has full row rank. This is the owner field
`is_minimal_representation.full_row_rank`. -/

/-- Corollary 3.32 (2): if the mixed system `Aeq *ᵥ x = beq`, `Aineq *ᵥ x ≤ bineq` is a minimal
representation of its nonempty solution polyhedron `P`, then `rank Aeq = n - dim P`, where
`dim P` is the affine dimension of `P`. -/

/- Corollary 3.32 (3): if the mixed system `Aeq *ᵥ x = beq`, `Aineq *ᵥ x ≤ bineq` is a minimal
representation of its solution polyhedron `P`, then the inequality subsystem has as many rows as
`P` has facets. This is the canonical theorem `minimal_representation_facet_rows_count`. -/
recall minimal_representation_facet_rows_count

/- Corollary 3.32 (4): the rank and facet-count equalities above are necessary consequences of a
minimal representation, but they are not by themselves a converse criterion for the owner
`is_minimal_representation`. That owner also contains the affine-hull equation description
`eq_affine_hull` and the rowwise/facetwise correspondence fields `row_is_facet` and
`facets_exhausted`, so this file does not introduce a converse theorem from the numerical
equalities alone. -/
