-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Lemma 7.15 is source-facing in `flow_cover_recursive_lifting_eq_lifting_function`: the
recursive functions `fᵢ i` from `(7.19)` coincide with the lifting function `f` on `0 ≤ z ≤ b`.

The lifted inequality expressions that use those coefficients later in the chapter already live
under the canonical owner `OrderedFlowCover.flow_cover_lifted_value` from Theorem 7.16. This
supplemental file therefore keeps only direct recalls of the source-facing lemma and that owner,
rather than a parallel local `value`/`valid`/`pair-lifting` API. -/
