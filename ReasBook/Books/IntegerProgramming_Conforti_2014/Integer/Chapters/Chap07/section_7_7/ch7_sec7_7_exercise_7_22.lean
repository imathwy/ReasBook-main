mixing-set datum `b` and every rational query point `y`, the separation problem for the mixing
inequalities `(4.29)` reduces to deciding whether a shortest-path instance on a graph with at most
`C * n + C` nodes has a negative `s,t` path, and the separation problem for the mixing
inequalities `(4.30)` reduces to deciding whether a shortest-path instance on a graph with at most
`C * n + C` nodes contains a negative-cost directed cycle. -/
