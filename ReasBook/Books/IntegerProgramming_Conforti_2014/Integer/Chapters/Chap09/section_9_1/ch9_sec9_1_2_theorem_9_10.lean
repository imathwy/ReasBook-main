/-- Theorem 9.10. For each fixed dimension `n`, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that,
given `A ∈ ℚ^(m × n)` and `b ∈ ℚ^m` such that
`P = {x ∈ ℝ^n | A x ≤ b}` is a full-dimensional compact polyhedron, outputs either an integral
point of `P` or a nonzero vector `d ∈ ℤ^n` such that
`w_{d}(P) ≤ n (n + 1) 2^{n (n - 1) / 4}`. -/
