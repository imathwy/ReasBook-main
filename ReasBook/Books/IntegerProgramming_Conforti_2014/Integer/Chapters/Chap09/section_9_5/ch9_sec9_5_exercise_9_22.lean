-- Domain-style sampling for this file:
-- * primary domain: branch-and-bound enumeration trees for a symmetric binary MILP
-- * sampled owner abstractions:
--   - Chapter 9.5 `EnumerationTree` with its canonical `rootLabel` and `size` API
--   - Exercise 9.20's explicit source-facing enumeration object, which keeps only the symmetry
--     reduced data instead of rebuilding tree owners
--   - Exercise 9.21's recall-only pattern for purely canonical upstream notions
-- * source/core/bridge triage:
--   - `Exercise922Node` and the recursive tree are source-facing
--   - `EnumerationTree` is the core/canonical owner
--   - the public root/size theorems are bridge facts derived from that owner API
-- * primitive data: the explicit node labels and the recursive left-spine/right-leaf tree shape
-- * derived API: canonical `EnumerationTree.rootLabel` and `EnumerationTree.size` facts

/-- A node in the explicit Exercise 9.22 branch-and-bound tree. `spine m` means that the first `m`
variables have been fixed to `0` by repeated left branches. `rightLeaf m` is the right child
obtained by branching on `x_m = 1`, after which orbital fixing sets every other still-unfixed
variable to `0`. -/

/-- Exercise 9.22. For the `0,1` linear program
`max ∑_{j=1}^n x_j` with constraints `x_i + x_j + x_k ≤ 2` on distinct indices and `n ≥ 3`,
the complete branch-and-bound enumeration tree with isomorphism pruning and orbital fixing is the
left-spine tree that repeatedly branches on the next unfixed variable, fathoms each right child by
fixing all remaining variables to `0`, and terminates once only two variables remain unfixed. -/
