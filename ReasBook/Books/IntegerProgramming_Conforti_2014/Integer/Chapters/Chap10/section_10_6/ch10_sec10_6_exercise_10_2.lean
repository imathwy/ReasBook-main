/- Source/core/bridge triage for Exercise 10.2:
* `source-facing`: the exercise recalls the two textbook equivalences for positive semidefinite
  real matrices.
* `core/canonical`: Chapter 10 Proposition 10.2 already owns those source-facing theorems as
  `posSemidef_iff_exists_transpose_mul_self` and
  `symmetric_posSemidef_iff_nonneg_det_principal_submatrix`.
* `bridge/view`: this file is therefore recall-only, exports the canonical owner declarations
  directly, and keeps no parallel local wrapper API or debug-only `#check` surface. -/

/-- Exercise 10.2. Proposition 10.2 is already available in the canonical owner file through the
