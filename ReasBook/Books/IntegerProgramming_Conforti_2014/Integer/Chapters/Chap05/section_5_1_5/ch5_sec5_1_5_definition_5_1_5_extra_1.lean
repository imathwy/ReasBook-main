/- Definition 5.1.5-extra-1 is a `source-facing` recall, not a second MIR owner:
the Chapter 5 canonical owner file
`ch5_sec5_1_5_theorem_5_12.lean`
already defines the mixed integer rounding inequality predicate, the mixed integer rounding
closure, and the corresponding membership theorem. This file therefore recalls those canonical
declarations directly instead of keeping a duplicate local API. -/
