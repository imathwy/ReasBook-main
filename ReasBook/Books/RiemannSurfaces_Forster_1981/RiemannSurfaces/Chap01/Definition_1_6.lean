/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: `mdifferentiable_iff`, `mdifferentiableOn_iff_of_subset_source`.
- Verified locally: `MDifferentiable`, `mdifferentiableOn_iff_of_subset_source`,
  `mdifferentiable_iff`, `TopologicalSpace.Opens.instChartedSpace`, and
  `TopologicalSpace.Opens.chartAt_eq`.
- Owner choice: `RiemannSurface.HolomorphicOn` is the source-facing owner on the open-subset
  carrier `Y : Opens X`, kept as a thin bridge around `MDifferentiable`; chartwise wording is
  recovered as a companion theorem on the induced chosen charts of `Y` rather than by
  introducing a bundled holomorphic-function owner.
