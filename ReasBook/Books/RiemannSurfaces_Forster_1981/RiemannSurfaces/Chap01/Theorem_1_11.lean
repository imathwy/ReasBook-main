/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: analytic identity-theorem hits around
  `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_frequently_eq`.
- Verified locally: `RiemannSurface.Holomorphic`, `Set.EqOn`, and `AccPt`.
- Owner choice: keep the source-facing identity theorem with the accumulation-point hypothesis
  stated explicitly as `AccPt a (Filter.principal A)`, but expose it on the minimal connected
  complex-manifold layer and add the closure-form companion theorem used by downstream topology
  arguments.

/-- Theorem 1.11 (Identity Theorem): if two holomorphic maps between Riemann surfaces agree on a
set with an accumulation point, then they agree everywhere. The Lean statement only assumes the
connected complex-manifold structure actually used by the argument, so it applies in particular to
maps between Riemann surfaces. -/
