- Verified locally: `biholomorphicGroupoid`, `hasGroupoid_of_holomorphicallyCompatible`,
  `ChartedSpace`, `HasGroupoid`, and `IsManifold`.
- Owner choice: `RiemannSurface` is a source-facing Prop-valued class on the ambient
  `[ChartedSpace ℂ X]` surface, with connectedness and the canonical analytic-manifold owner
  `IsManifold 𝓘(ℂ) ω X` exposed as parents rather than bundled atlas data.

/-- Definition 1.4: a Riemann surface is a connected Hausdorff topological space `X` equipped with
a chosen complex charted-space structure whose transition maps belong to the biholomorphic
groupoid. One usually writes `X` instead of `(X, Σ)` once the complex structure is understood;
representative atlases `(X, 𝔄)` are recovered through the ambient `ChartedSpace` data and the
induced analytic manifold structure `IsManifold 𝓘(ℂ) ω X`. -/
