/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: `AnalyticOn.eval_polynomial`, `Polynomial.tendsto_norm_atTop`,
  `Polynomial.isProperMap_eval`.
- Verified locally: the chapter already models the Riemann sphere as `OnePoint ℂ`, uses the global
  owners `Holomorphic`, `MeromorphicOn`, and `𝓜(Y)`, and exposes
  `RiemannSurface (OnePoint ℂ)` in `Example_1_5`.
- Owner choice: keep the source polynomial as the canonical `Polynomial ℂ`, record the chosen
  finite value at `∞` as explicit data of the sphere-side extension, state holomorphicity on `ℂ`
  with `Holomorphic`, encode the growth-at-infinity clause with the cocompact filter on `ℂ`, and
  express the final conclusion primarily as `MeromorphicOn` on the top open subset of
  `OnePoint ℂ`, with `𝓜(Y)` membership as a companion surface.
