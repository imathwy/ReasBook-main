/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: `Complex.differentiableOn_update_limUnder_of_bddAbove`.
- Verified locally: `HolomorphicOn`, `Bornology.IsBounded`, and the punctured-open packaging once
  the necessary separation hypothesis is made explicit.
- Owner choice: keep the source-facing extension theorem on an open subset of a complex manifold,
  with a thin `puncturedOpen` companion matching the existing `HolomorphicOn : Opens X → _` API;
  this then specializes directly to the Riemann-surface setting used in the text.

/-- Theorem 1.8: if a holomorphic function on the punctured open subset `U \ {a}` is bounded near
`a`, then it admits a unique holomorphic extension to `U`. The boundedness hypothesis is stated in
the canonical filter form `BoundedAtPuncture U a f`; the companion theorem
`boundedAtPuncture_iff` recovers the textbook neighborhood formulation. The Lean statement keeps
only the local complex-manifold assumptions actually used by the theorem, so it applies in
particular on any Riemann surface. -/

/-- Theorem 1.8 (1): if a holomorphic function on the punctured open subset `U \ {a}` is bounded
in some neighborhood of `a`, then it extends to a holomorphic function on `U`. The neighborhood
need not be stated as contained in `U`, since the function is already only evaluated on
`puncturedOpen U a`. This is the source-facing neighborhood version of
`riemannRemovableSingularities`, stated on the same local complex-manifold hypotheses. -/
