/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: pullback algebra hom on sections/continuous functions, manifold
  differentiability composition.
- Verified locally: `RiemannSurface.Holomorphic`, `HolomorphicOn`, `𝒪`,
  `ContinuousMap.comp`, `Opens.comap`, `Opens.comap_comap`, `Subalgebra.comap`,
  `Subalgebra.val`, and `AlgHom.codRestrict`.
- Owner choice: keep the existing `Holomorphic` and `HolomorphicOn` predicates as the source-facing
  owners, represent holomorphic functions on `V` by `𝒪(V)`, and encode pullback by explicit
  precomposition on function algebras before restricting to holomorphic functions.

holomorphicity as a complex-valued function on the whole surface; this criterion already depends
only on the underlying complex-charted-space structure. -/
