/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: `chartAt`, `OpenPartialHomeomorph.bijOn`, `StructureGroupoid.compatible`.
- Verified locally: `chartAt`, `OpenPartialHomeomorph.bijOn`, `holomorphicallyCompatible`, and
  `StructureGroupoid.compatible`.
- Owner choice: keep the remark on the canonical `ChartedSpace`/`HasGroupoid` layer. The local
  model clause is witnessed by `chartAt ℂ x`, while chart-independence is stated for arbitrary
  atlas charts so no chart is treated as mathematically distinguished.

variable {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [ChartedSpace ℂ X]

/-- Remark 1-extra-2 (1): for each point of a Riemann surface, the chosen chart at that point
identifies an open neighborhood of the point bijectively with an open subset of `ℂ`. -/
theorem chartAt_bijOn (x : X) :
    Set.BijOn (chartAt ℂ x) (chartAt ℂ x).source (chartAt ℂ x).target :=
  (chartAt ℂ x).bijOn

/-- Remark 1-extra-2 (2): any two complex charts belonging to the atlas of a Riemann surface have
biholomorphic transition map, so chartwise notions descend exactly when they are invariant under
such changes of coordinates. -/
