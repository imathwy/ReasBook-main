/- Semantic recall:
- `lean_leansearch`: `MDifferentiable`, `Structomorph`, `mdifferentiable_iff`.
- Verified locally: `MDifferentiable.continuous`, `MDifferentiable.comp`, `Structomorph.refl`,
  `Structomorph.symm`, `Structomorph.trans`, and the `extChartAt` chartwise form of
  `mdifferentiable_iff`.
- Owner choice: `Holomorphic` is the thin source-facing predicate on maps between Riemann
  surfaces; clause (2) reuses the canonical bundled owner `Structomorph biholomorphicGroupoid X Y`,
  and `isomorphic` is its existence predicate.
