-- Domain sampling:
-- * primary domain: second-order constrained optimization for a concrete no-constraint example
-- * inspected owner chain:
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem` from `Chapter01.Definition_1_1_extra_1`
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem.activeIneqIndexSet` from `Definition_8_1_1`
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem.linearizedNullConstraintDirections` from `Definition_8_3_2`
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem.lagrangianHessianQuadratic` from `Theorem_8_3_3`
-- * owner abstraction used here: the existing Chapter 8 constrained-problem/KKT/null-direction
--   surface, specialized to the unconstrained quartic example
-- * primitive data: the quartic objective and the empty constraint family
-- * derived API reused directly: KKT points, `G(xStar, lamStar)`, and the Lagrangian Hessian
--   quadratic form
