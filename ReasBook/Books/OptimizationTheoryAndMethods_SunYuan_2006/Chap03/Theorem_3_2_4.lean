-- Domain sampling for this refine pass:
-- * primary domain: finite-run stationarity and nonterminating-run accumulation-point minimizer
--   statements for the Chapter 3 damped Newton method on `ℝⁿ`;
-- * inspected owner declarations:
--   - `NewtonMethodWithLineSearch` in `Algorithm_3_2_3`;
--   - `NewtonMethodWithLineSearch.DoesNotTerminate` / `terminatedAt` in `Algorithm_3_2_3`;
--   - `IsStationaryPoint` in `Chapter01/Definition_1_4_7`;
--   - `HasLowerLevelHessianLowerBound` / `lowerLevelSetOn` in `Chapter01/Theorem_1_3_19`;
--   - `IsMinOn` as the canonical minimizer owner and the Chapter 3 stronger companion
--     `newtonSequence_tendsto_minimizer` in `Theorem_3_2_5`.
--
-- Best owner abstraction:
-- * source-facing owner: `NewtonMethodWithLineSearch`;
-- * derived canonical owners: `IsStationaryPoint` for the finite zero-tolerance branch and
--   `IsMinOn` for the infinite-run minimizer conclusion on the regularity domain `D`.
--
-- Primitive data vs derived API:
-- * primitive data live in the algorithm owner itself: iterates, gradients, Hessians,
--   line-search data, the nonnegative stopping tolerance, the stop test `terminatedAt`, and the
--   stronger nontermination owner `DoesNotTerminate`;
-- * this file only adds the source-facing zero-tolerance finite-run hypothesis and the
--   lower-level-set Hessian hypotheses needed for Theorem 3.2.4;
-- * the nonterminating clause is kept at the accumulation-point layer rather than the stronger
--   full-sequence convergence layer of `Theorem_3_2_5`;
-- * part `(2)` keeps only the source accumulation-point data on the labeled theorem surface;
--   the required lower-level-set bookkeeping is pushed into a bridge theorem that derives
--   eventual membership in `lowerLevelSetOn D f A.x0` from openness of `D`, convergence to
--   `xStar ∈ D`, and the owner-level exact-line-search monotonicity lemma
--   `NewtonMethodWithLineSearch.objective_nonincreasing_step`;
-- * the stronger theorem `newtonSequence_tendsto_minimizer` from `Theorem_3_2_5` remains a
--   companion, not a replacement, because it adds the extra decrease assumption `(3.2.13)`;
-- * source/core/bridge triage for part `(2)`:
--   source-facing = accumulation points of a genuinely nonterminating damped Newton run together
--   with the source-level regularity assumptions on `D`,
--   core/canonical = `IsMinOn f D xStar`,
--   bridge/view = eventual sampled membership in `lowerLevelSetOn D f A.x0` derived from the
--   run and convergence data; any later result upgrading `IsMinOn f D xStar` to
--   `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar` must be stated separately from this theorem.

/-- Chapter03 Theorem 3.2.4 (1). If the run of Algorithm 3.2.3 generated from `A.x0`
is finite and the stopping tolerance is zero, then some terminal iterate is a stationary
point of `f`. The implementation-level equality `A.g k = 0` is kept upstream as an auxiliary
recorded-gradient fact, while the theorem here uses the canonical Chapter 1 owner
`IsStationaryPoint` together with the source-facing Chapter 3 terminal-index owner
`A.IsTerminalIndex k`. -/

the lower-level-set Hessian owner into a bridge lemma, rather than exposing it on the main
Theorem 3.2.4 statement. -/

/-- Primitive accumulation-point minimizer conclusion for Theorem 3.2.4 (2): once the sampled
subsequence of a genuinely nonterminating damped Newton run is known to enter the canonical lower
level set `lowerLevelSetOn D f A.x0` eventually, any accumulation point `xStar ∈ D` of that
subsequence is a minimizer of `f` on `D`. This keeps the core theorem-level input at the
lower-level-set owner rather than storing run-specific domain bookkeeping as primitive data. -/

/-- Chapter03 Theorem 3.2.4 (2). If the run of Algorithm 3.2.3 generated from `A.x0` never
satisfies its stop test, and the Chapter 1 open/convex/regularity/lower-level-set Hessian
hypotheses hold on `D`, then every accumulation point `xStar ∈ D` of the Newton iterates is a
minimizer of `f` on `D`. This keeps the labeled source-facing theorem at the accumulation-point
layer and avoids collapsing it into the stronger full-sequence convergence statement of
`Theorem_3_2_5`. The nontermination hypothesis is phrased with the algorithm owner's source stop
test `terminatedAt`, not with the weaker no-constant-tail predicate `IsInfiniteSequence`, because
the textbook meaning is that the Newton run remains active at every index. The lower-level-set
membership needed by the Chapter 1 Hessian-bound owner is derived internally from openness of
`D`, convergence to `xStar ∈ D`, and exact-line-search monotonicity, so the theorem surface no
longer asks users to provide a separate iterate-in-`D` bookkeeping hypothesis. -/
