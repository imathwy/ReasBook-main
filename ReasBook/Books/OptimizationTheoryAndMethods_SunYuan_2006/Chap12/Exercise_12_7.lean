-- Domain sampling for this refine pass:
-- * primary domain: Chapter 12 reduced-Hessian iterations for equality-constrained problems;
-- * sampled owner declarations:
--   `EqualityConstrainedProblem.constraintVector`,
--   `EqualityConstrainedProblem.constraintGradientMatrix`,
--   the single-constraint companion pattern from `Exercise_12_5`,
--   `IsReducedNullMap` and `IsReducedHessianStep` from `Theorem_12_8_1`,
--   `HasSuperlinearlyConvergentStep` from `Definition_12_3_extra_1`,
--   and mathlib's `=O[atTop]`;
-- * source-facing layer kept here: the concrete Exercise 12.7 objective, scalar constraint,
--   its denominator-safe domain, the iterate recursion, and the one-fast-one-slow convergence
--   conclusion;
-- * core/canonical layer reused here: the chapter owners `EqualityConstrainedProblem` and
--   `IsReducedHessianStep`, mathlib's `gradient`, and the standard gradient-matrix owner
--   `exercise127Problem.constraintGradientMatrix` viewed through `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`;
-- * primitive data vs derived API:
--   primitive/source data are the concrete objective, scalar equality constraint, denominator
--   domain, iterate recursion, and solution;
--   derived API are the concrete owner `exercise127Problem` and its single-constraint vector
--   and gradient-matrix views `exercise127Problem.constraintVector` and
--   `exercise127Problem.constraintGradientMatrix`;
-- * bridge/view layer here: the equality-constrained owner's canonical gradient matrix viewed
--   as a Euclidean linear map through `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`.

/-- Chapter12 Exercise 12.7: there is a threshold `δ > 0` such that whenever
`0 < ε < δ`, there exist concrete stage directions `d_k`, reduced-Hessian operators `B_k`, and
reduced-space maps `Z_k` for the Exercise 12.7 process started from
`exercise127InitialPoint ε = (ε, ε)` such that each stage point `x_k` stays in the source
domain `x_k 1 ≠ 1` and each stage direction satisfies the chapter's canonical
`IsReducedHessianStep` owner specialized to the concrete equality-constrained owner
`exercise127Problem`, using the source-facing single-constraint Jacobian owner
`exercise127ConstraintJacobian` for the linearized constraint map, so the reduced-null-map
condition on each `Z_k` is carried by that canonical owner.
The induced iterate sequence `exercise127Iterates ε d` then converges to
`exercise127Solution = (0, 0)`, and the first coordinate error is `O` of the square of the
second coordinate error, expressed by `HasOneFastOneSlowConvergenceTo`. -/
