-- Primary domain: equality-constrained minimization in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space.
-- Sampled owners:
-- * `IsMinOn` is the canonical minimizer predicate.
-- * `LinearEqualityConstrainedProblem` from Chapter 11 is the owner for affine equality
--   constraints `Aᵀ x = b`, with `x ∈ problem` as the public feasible-point surface and
--   `problem.feasibleSet` as the underlying set-valued minimization domain.
-- The exercise-specific primitive data are the quartic objective and the eliminated
-- one-variable quartic; the feasible-set API is derived from the Chapter 11 owner object.
