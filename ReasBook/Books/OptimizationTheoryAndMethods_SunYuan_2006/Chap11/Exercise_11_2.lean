-- Domain sampling:
-- * mathlib owner: `IsMinOn`
-- * project source-facing owners: `exercise89FeasibleSet`, `exercise89SquaredDistanceToOrigin`,
--   and `exercise89NearestPoint`
-- Layer triage:
-- * source-facing: the explicit ellipse and squared-distance problem already formalized in
--   Chapter 8 Exercise 8.9
-- * core/canonical: `IsMinOn` on that feasible set
-- * bridge/view: the uniqueness theorem below, with the explicit feasibility hypothesis that
--   `IsMinOn` itself does not encode

/- Chapter11 Exercise 11.2 is the same nearest-point-on-an-ellipse problem already formalized in
Chapter08 Exercise 8.9, so this file reuses the Chapter 8 source-facing owners directly instead
of reintroducing parallel local definitions. -/

/-- Any feasible minimizer of the squared distance to the origin on the Exercise 11.2 ellipse is
the explicit point `exercise89NearestPoint = (1 / 3, 2 / 3, 0)`. The feasibility hypothesis is
essential because `IsMinOn` alone does not imply membership in `exercise89FeasibleSet`. -/
