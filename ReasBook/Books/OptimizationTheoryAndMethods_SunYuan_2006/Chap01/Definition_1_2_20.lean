-- Semantic recall: `HolderOnWith`, `holderOnWith_one`, and
-- `HolderOnWith.continuousOn` are the canonical mathlib Hölder owners for fixed parameters.
-- The textbook definition below is source-facing and existential in those parameters, so it is
-- kept as a thin bridge on top of that owner. The local-at-a-point notion is also phrased through
-- `HolderOnWith` on a neighborhood within the set, rather than re-stating the same inequality
-- entrywise.
