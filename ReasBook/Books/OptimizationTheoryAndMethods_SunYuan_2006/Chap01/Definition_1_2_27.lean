/-- `A` is a Gateaux derivative of `f` within `D` at `x` if its values give all directional
line derivatives of `f` there. This is the chapter's source-facing Gateaux bridge, owned at the

/-- Chapter01 Definition 1.2.27, expressed at the generic normed-space owner level:
`f` is Gateaux differentiable at `x` on the open set `D` if `D` is open, `x ∈ D`, and there is
a continuous linear map `A` such that every directional line derivative of `f` within `D` at `x`
is `A d`. The source `ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ` statement is recovered by specializing to Euclidean spaces over
`ℝ`.

This uses `HasLineDerivWithinAt` as the mathlib encoding of the limit formula
`lim α → 0, ‖α‖⁻¹ * ‖f (x + α • d) - f x - α • A d‖ = 0`. -/
