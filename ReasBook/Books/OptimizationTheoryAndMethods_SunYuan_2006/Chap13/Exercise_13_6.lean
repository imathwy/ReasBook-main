Chapter13 Exercise 13.6

Discuss the local convergence properties of Powell-Yuan's trust-region algorithm.

Domain sampling pass:
* primary domain: local convergence of the Chapter 13 Powell-Yuan trust-region method;
* inspected project declarations:
  `PowellYuanTrustRegionMethod`,
  `PowellYuanTrustRegionMethod.finitelyTerminates`,
  `PowellYuanTrustRegionMethod.satisfiesAssumption1362`,
  `PowellYuanTrustRegionMethod.tendsto_radius_zero_of_not_finitelyTerminates`;
* owner abstraction: `PowellYuanTrustRegionMethod`;
* source/core/bridge triage:
  - source-facing: the two local-convergence clauses of Exercise 13.6;
  - core/canonical: the Chapter 13 theorem owners in `Lemma_13_6_7.lean`;
  - bridge/view: none in this file, since the exercise is exact recall.

This is a source-facing recall item. The two local-convergence clauses already live on the
canonical Chapter 13 owner `PowellYuanTrustRegionMethod` in `Lemma_13_6_7.lean`, so this file
reuses those theorem owners directly instead of restating their telescopes through local
`example` wrappers.

/- Clause (1): under Chapter 13 Assumption 13.6.2, if the Powell-Yuan trust-region run does not
terminate finitely, then the trust-region radii `Δ_k` converge to `0`, encoded on the shifted
sequence `k ↦ method.radius (k + 1)`. -/

/- Clause (2): under Chapter 13 Assumption 13.6.2, if the Powell-Yuan trust-region run does not
terminate finitely, then the Euclidean constraint-residual norms `‖c_k‖₂` converge to `0`,
encoded on the shifted sequence `k ↦ ‖method.constraintResidual (k + 1)‖`. -/
