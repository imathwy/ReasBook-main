-- Source/core/bridge triage:
-- * source-facing item: the exercise asks for the theorem proved in Chapter05 Theorem 5.4.3;
-- * core/canonical owner: `quasiNewton_superlinear_iff_secantErrorRatio_tendsto_zero`;
-- * bridge/view: none is needed here, because the exercise is a pure recall of that theorem.
-- This file therefore reuses the existing Chapter 5 owner directly instead of restating its full

Chapter05 Exercise 5.8: prove Theorem 5.4.3.

This exercise is a canonical recall item. The result is already formalized as
`quasiNewton_superlinear_iff_secantErrorRatio_tendsto_zero` in
`SunYuanOptimizationTheoryMethods.Chap05.Theorem_5_4_3`, so the exercise reuses that owner
directly and introduces no duplicate local theorem surface.
