-- Domain sampling:
-- * primary domain: second-order sufficiency for a concrete Chapter 8 constrained problem
-- * inspected owner declarations in this domain:
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem.IsKKTPoint` from `Theorem_8_2_7`
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem.linearizedNullConstraintDirections` from `Definition_8_3_2`
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem.lagrangianHessianQuadratic` from `Theorem_8_3_3`
--   `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem
--      .isStrictLocalMinOn_of_positive_lagrangianHessian_on_linearizedNullConstraintDirections`
--   from `Theorem_8_3_4`
-- * semantic recall via `lean_leansearch`: no more specific mathlib/project owner surfaced than
--   the chapter KKT/SOSC API already used here
-- * owner abstraction chosen here: the chapter owner `ConstrainedOptimizationProblem`
-- * primitive data kept here: the exercise objective, the single inequality-constraint family,
--   the resulting constrained problem, and its explicit source-facing candidate data
-- * derived API deleted from the local file: the bespoke feasible-set and SOSC wrapper
--   definitions, now replaced by the canonical KKT/null-direction/Hessian owners
-- * transport note: the source uses the Euclidean norm on `ℝ^n`; on the chapter owner
--   `Point = Fin n → ℝ`, that norm is expressed via `WithLp.toLp 2`
