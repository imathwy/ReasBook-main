/- Chapter03 Assumption 3.6-extra-1: the nonlinear equation `F x = 0` on a real normed
space has a solution `xStar` such that `F` is continuously differentiable on a neighborhood of
`xStar` and `fderiv ℝ F xStar` is invertible.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: existence of a regular zero for `F`
* core/canonical: the Chapter 3.6 owner `IsRegularZero`
* bridge/view: none; this assumption is exactly the existential reuse of `IsRegularZero`

The previous public predicate `HasInexactNewtonAssumptions` and its `_iff` theorem duplicated
the already adequate Chapter 3.6 owner surface and had no downstream users. This file therefore
stays at the recall layer and records the source-facing proposition anonymously. -/
