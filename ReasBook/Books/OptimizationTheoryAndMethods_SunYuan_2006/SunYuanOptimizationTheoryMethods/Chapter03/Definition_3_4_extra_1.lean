-- Semantic recall: mathlib's canonical finite-difference owner is `dslope`, and
-- `HasDerivAt.tendsto_slope_zero` / `hasDerivAt_iff_tendsto_slope_zero` express
-- that these finite-difference quotients approximate the derivative as the step tends to `0`.

/- Chapter03 Definition 3.4-extra-1: finite-difference Newton's method replaces the exact
derivative data in Newton's method by finite-difference quotients. In mathlib, the canonical
finite-difference quotient at `x` with step `h` is `dslope f x (x + h)`, and its convergence to
the derivative is recorded by the slope-limit API below. -/

/-- Helper for Chapter03 Definition 3.4-extra-1: for a nonzero step `h`, the canonical
finite-difference quotient `dslope f x (x + h)` is the textbook forward quotient
`(f (x + h) - f x) / h`. -/
