-- Domain sampling:
-- * source-facing Step 3 owner: `InexactLineSearchAcceptance`;
-- * chapter iterate package: `InexactLineSearchMethod`;
-- * derived Step 3 expansion: `InexactLineSearchMethod.stepSpec`;
-- * theorem owner for the exercise outline: `inexactLineSearch_globalConvergence`.
-- Primitive data live in the inexact-line-search acceptance/method owners above; the exercise

/- Chapter02 Exercise 2.8

The source item is expository: it asks for the outline of Chapter02 Theorem 2.5.4 rather than for
new source-facing mathematical data. The correct public layer is therefore the existing chapter
theorem `inexactLineSearch_globalConvergence`, with `InexactLineSearchAcceptance` and
`InexactLineSearchMethod.stepSpec` as the nearby source-facing Step 3 owners that unpack its
accepted inexact line-search hypothesis.
