/- Chapter02 Definition 2.4-extra-1.
Interpolation methods for line search approximate `lineSearchObjective f x d` on the current
bracketing interval by fitting a quadratic or cubic `Polynomial ℝ` to known sampled data,
choose a new `α` that minimizes the polynomial model on that bracket, and then reduce the
bracketing interval by comparing the new `α` with the previously known points.

The source does not define one single algorithmic owner, but it does use a reusable notion:
a polynomial model whose values agree with the line-search objective at finitely many sampled
step sizes. Choosing a minimizer of that model on the current bracket then remains the canonical
surface `IsMinOn (fun t ↦ p.eval t) (Set.Icc a b) α`.
