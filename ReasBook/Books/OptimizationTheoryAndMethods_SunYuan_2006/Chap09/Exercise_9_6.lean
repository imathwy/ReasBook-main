-- Domain sampling:
-- * source-facing layer: the smallest-enclosing-circle exercise on center/radius-squared pairs
--   and dual simplex multipliers;
-- * core/canonical owners inspected: `IsMinOn`, `IsMaxOn`, `Metric.closedBall`, `stdSimplex`,
--   `Finset.centerMass`;
-- * owner choice: keep the source-facing center/radius primitive data for the primal feasible set
--   because the radius varies with the point, so `Metric.closedBall` is only a companion
--   geometric owner here, while the dual feasible region itself is canonically `stdSimplex`.
-- * bridge/view decision: keep the raw weighted dual sum because the dual objective is defined on
--   all multipliers, then expose the canonical `centerMass` view on the feasible simplex where
--   the weights sum to `1`.
