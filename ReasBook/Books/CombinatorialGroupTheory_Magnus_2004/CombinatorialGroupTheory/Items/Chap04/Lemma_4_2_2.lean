Primary domain: HNN extensions and Britton's lemma.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a reduced sequence `g₀, t^{ε₁}, g₁, ..., t^{εₙ}, gₙ` with `n ≥ 1`, viewed as a
  reduced word in the HNN extension.
- `core/canonical`: `ReducedWord G B A` is mathlib's owner abstraction for reduced words in the
  source stable-letter convention, and
  `HNNExtension.ReducedWord.toList_eq_nil_of_mem_of_range` is Britton's lemma for that owner.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook integer `n` counting occurrences of the stable letter is the length
  of `w.toList`, while `w.toHNNExtension φ` evaluates the source word in the original HNN
  extension `HNNExtension G A B φ`.

Domain sampling:
1. `ReducedWord G B A` is the canonical reduced-word owner for the source stable-letter
   convention.
2. `HNNExtension.swapEquiv φ` is the canonical stable-letter inversion equivalence between the two
   HNN-extension conventions.
3. `ReducedWord.toHNNExtension φ` is the project bridge evaluating such a source word in the
   original HNN extension.
4. `HNNExtension.ReducedWord.toList_eq_nil_of_mem_of_range` is the owner Britton theorem asserting
   that a reduced word whose product lies in the embedded base group has no stable letters.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the reduced word `w : ReducedWord G B A`;
- derived source hypothesis: `w.toList ≠ []`, encoding that the reduced sequence has at least one
  stable-letter syllable;
- derived conclusion: `w.toHNNExtension φ ≠ 1`, the thin source-facing contrapositive of Britton's
  lemma transported through `swapEquiv`.

/-- Lemma 4-2-2: if a reduced HNN word has at least one stable-letter syllable, then its product
in the HNN extension is not the identity. Equivalently, a reduced sequence
`g₀, t^{ε₁}, g₁, ..., t^{εₙ}, gₙ` with `n ≥ 1` does not represent `1`. -/
