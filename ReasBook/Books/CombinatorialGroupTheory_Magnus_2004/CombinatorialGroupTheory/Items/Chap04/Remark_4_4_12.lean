Primary domain: residual finiteness and Hopfianity for the Baumslag-Solitar group `BS(2,3)`.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the textbook consequence that `BS(2,3)` is not residually finite.
- `core/canonical`: `Group.ResiduallyFinite`, `IsHopfian`, the chapter theorem `not_isHopfian`,
  and the owner instance `isHopfian_of_fg_residuallyFinite`.
- `bridge/view`: this remark is the direct contradiction between those owner-level facts, so it
  should stay a thin theorem rather than introducing a new endomorphism-level wrapper.

Domain sampling:
1. `Group.ResiduallyFinite` is mathlib's owner predicate for residual finiteness.
2. `IsHopfian` from Proposition `1-3-5` is the chapter owner predicate for Hopfianity.
3. `not_isHopfian` from Theorem `4-4-11` is the canonical non-Hopfianity result for `BS(2,3)`.
4. `isHopfian_of_fg_residuallyFinite` from Theorem `4-4-13` is the canonical owner instance
   turning finite generation and residual finiteness into Hopfianity.

Primitive vs. derived:
the only new public content here is the source-facing failure of residual finiteness. The Hopfian
instance and the non-Hopfian counterexample already live upstream, so the remark should expose only
their direct owner-level consequence.
