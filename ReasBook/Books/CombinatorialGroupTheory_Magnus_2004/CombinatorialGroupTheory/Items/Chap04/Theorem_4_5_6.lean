-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a cyclically reduced relator word `relator`, a freely reduced word `w`, a
-- second word `v` omitting some generator occurring in `w`, and equality of the two words in the
-- one-relator torsion quotient with defining relator `(FreeGroup.mk relator) ^ n`.
-- `core/canonical`: Proposition `2-5-27` is the existing owner theorem for long overlaps in the
-- quotient `PresentedGroup ({s ^ n} : Set (FreeGroup X))`, using `List.IsInfix`,
-- `basisLetterOccurs basis`, `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced`, and `PresentedGroup.mk`.
-- `bridge/view`: this file keeps the stronger source-facing omission hypothesis on the displayed
-- list word `v` and specializes the owner theorem to the displayed reduced words.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `exists_long_common_part_with_relator_of_eq_in_power_relator_quotient` from Proposition
--    `2-5-27` is the chapter's owner theorem for the long-overlap conclusion in a torsion
--    one-relator quotient.
-- 2. `basisLetterOccurs basis` from Proposition `1-7-4` is the existing occurrence predicate for
--    generators in the canonical reduced word of a free-group element.
-- 3. `List.IsInfix` from mathlib is the owner predicate for consecutive subwords of reduced
--    words.
-- 4. Mathlib's `FreeGroup.pow_mk`, `FreeGroup.toWord_mk`, and
--    `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced.flatten_replicate` are the canonical length API turning the
--    owner theorem's bound into the source-facing bound on `((FreeGroup.mk relator) ^ n).toWord`.
--
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive public data are the displayed words `relator`, `w`, `v`, the exponent `n`, and
-- the quotient equality between `w` and `v`; the canonical occurrence and long-overlap predicates
-- are derived bridge API used only internally to express the proof through the upstream owner
-- theorem.

/-- Theorem 4-5-6: if `G = ⟨X ; r^n = 1⟩` with `r` cyclically reduced and `n > 1`, and a freely
reduced word `w` is equal in `G` to a word `v` omitting some generator that occurs in `w`, then
`w` contains a contiguous subword that is also a subword of the reduced word of `r^n` or `r⁻ⁿ`,
and whose length is greater than `(n - 1) / n` times the length of `r^n`. The fractional bound is
rendered as the equivalent natural-number inequality
`n * segment.length > (n - 1) * (((FreeGroup.mk relator : FreeGroup X) ^ n).toWord.length)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: this is the long-overlap theorem for one-relator torsion groups. One applies the
-- Magnus breakdown of the equality `w = v` in the quotient by `r^n`, reducing first to the case
-- where the omitted generator occurs in the defining relator. Induct on the length of the
-- cyclically reduced relator and use the HNN-extension/free-product normal-form analysis to force
-- a long overlap between `w` and one of the cyclic conjugates of `r^n` or `r⁻ⁿ`.
