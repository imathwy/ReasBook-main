Primary domain: free products with amalgamation and their normal forms.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a reduced alternating word in the two-factor amalgamated product together with
  the textbook conclusion that a nonempty reduced word represents a nontrivial element.
- `core/canonical`: `Monoid.PushoutI` for the amalgamated product, `Monoid.PushoutI.Reduced` for
  the owner-side reducedness predicate, `Monoid.PushoutI.ofCoprodI` for evaluating a coproduct word
  in the pushout, and `Monoid.PushoutI.of_injective` for the factor embeddings.
- `bridge/view`: `Monoid.PushoutI.TwoFactorReduced` from `Definition_4_2_9` is the generic
  `Bool`-indexed bridge from the textbook two-factor reduced-word condition to the canonical
  predicate `Monoid.PushoutI.Reduced`, while
  `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.Reduced` is the subgroup-specialized source-facing owner for
  Definition `4-2-9`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.PushoutI.Reduced.eq_empty_of_mem_range` is the canonical normal-form theorem saying a
   nonempty reduced coproduct word cannot lie in the image of the base group.
2. `Monoid.PushoutI.of_injective` is the canonical injectivity theorem for the factor maps into an
   amalgamated product when the amalgamating maps are injective.
3. `Monoid.CoprodI.twoFactorAmalgamatingMaps` from `Definition_4_2_9` is the project owner for the
   two-factor pushout diagram and should be reused here instead of rebuilt locally.
4. `Monoid.PushoutI.TwoFactorReduced` is the generic bridge predicate used away from the subgroup
   specialization.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public inputs are the common group `A`, the two factor groups `G` and `H`, the maps
`φG : A →* G` and `φH : A →* H`, and a source-facing reduced word `w`. The pushout `P`, the
evaluation map of `w` in `P`, and the two factor embeddings are canonical derived objects, while
the generic reducedness bridge is imported from `Definition_4_2_9` rather than duplicated locally.

/-- Theorem 4-2-10: a reduced sequence of positive length in a free product with amalgamation
represents a nontrivial element of the pushout. -/
-- Proof sketch: if the reduced word has length one, its unique letter is already nontrivial
-- because `Monoid.CoprodI.Word` stores only nonidentity syllables. If the length is greater than
-- one, the source-facing reducedness condition identifies with the canonical
-- predicate `Monoid.PushoutI.Reduced`, via
-- `Monoid.PushoutI.twoFactorReduced_iff_of_one_lt_length`, and the pushout normal-form theorem
-- `Reduced.eq_empty_of_mem_range` rules out the product being the identity.
