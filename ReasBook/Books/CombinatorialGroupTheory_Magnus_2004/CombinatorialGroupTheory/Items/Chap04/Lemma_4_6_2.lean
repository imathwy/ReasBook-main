Primary domain: bipolar structures on groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: sector membership statements `g ∈ XY`, `h ∈ YZ`, the irreducibility of `h`,
  and the conclusion that `gh` is either fixed or lies in a sector with left pole `X`.
- `core/canonical`: `BipolarStructure` is the owner abstraction for the subgroup piece `F`, the
  sector family, and the owner-side irreducibility predicate `B.IsIrreducible g`.
- `bridge/view`: this lemma converts the source word “irreducible” into the canonical owner API
  from Definition `4-6-1`.

Domain sampling:
1. `BipolarStructure` is the project owner for the five-piece bipolar decomposition.
2. Its coercion to `Pole → Pole → Set G` supplies the sector notation `B X Y`.
3. `HasSectorFactorization` from Definition `4-6-1` is the primitive notion for admissible
   products along poles.
4. `B.IsIrreducible g` from Definition `4-6-1` is the chapter-facing owner API for the source
   notion “`g` admits no length-two admissible sector factorization”.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive source data are the bipolar structure `B`, the poles `X,Y,Z`, and the elements
`g,h` with their sector-membership assumptions. The irreducibility notion is already part of the
owner-side API imported from Definition `4-6-1`, so this file only states the first structural
consequence of that owner predicate.

/-- Lemma 4-6-2: if `g ∈ XY`, `h ∈ YZ`, and `h` admits no length-two admissible sector
factorization, then `gh` lies either in the fixed subgroup piece `F` or in some sector `XW`. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `gh ∉ F`, the covering axiom places `gh` in some sector `UW`. If `U ≠ X`,
-- then `U = star X`; inversion puts `g⁻¹` in `YX`, so the equality `h = g⁻¹ * (gh)` gives a
-- forbidden length-two sector factorization of `h`. Hence the only non-fixed possibility is a
-- sector with left pole `X`.
