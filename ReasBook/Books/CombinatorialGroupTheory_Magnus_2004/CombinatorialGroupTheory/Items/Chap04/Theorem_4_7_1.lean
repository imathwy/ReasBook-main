Primary domain: recursive presentations of finitely generated groups and Higman-style embedding
theorems.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a finitely generated group `G`, the textbook condition that `G` admit a
  recursive presentation, and the textbook conclusion that `G` embeds in some finitely presented
  group.
- `core/canonical`: `Group.FG G`, `Group.IsFinitelyPresented H`,
  `GroupPresentation.IsRecursive R`, the presentation bridge `PresentedGroup R ≃* G`, and
  injective homomorphisms `G →* H`.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook phrase “`G` can be recursively presented” is recorded by the group
  owner predicate `Group.IsRecursivelyPresented`, built directly from a finite-generator recursive
  presentation, while the embedding conclusion is stated in the chapter's direct existential style.

Domain sampling:
1. `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` is mathlib's owner predicate for finite presentability of an
   abstract group.
2. The surrounding chapter expresses embeddings source-faithfully as a homomorphism together with
   `Function.Injective`, so the group-level owner should package exactly that datum rather than a
   second wrapper object.
3. `GroupPresentation.IsRecursive R` is the project's owner predicate for recursive relator sets.
4. `PresentedGroup R ≃* G` from Definition `2-1-1` is the canonical bridge from a presentation to
   an abstract group.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data for recursive presentability: a finite generator count `n`, a relator set
  `R : Set (FreeGroup (Fin n))`, a presentation equivalence `PresentedGroup R ≃* G`, and a proof
  that `R` is recursive;
- derived API: the abstract group-level predicate `Group.IsRecursivelyPresented`, its direct
  constructor from an explicit presentation, the induced finite-generation instance
  `IsRecursivelyPresented.fg`, and the owner-side embedding consequence
  `IsRecursivelyPresented.exists_finitelyPresented_embedding`.

presented group if and only if it is recursively presented. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `G` embeds in a finitely presented group `H`, choose a finite presentation of
-- `H` and recursively enumerate the words whose values lie in the embedded copy of `G`; pulling
-- those relators back through the embedding yields a recursive presentation of `G`. Conversely,
-- Higman's construction uses iterated HNN extensions and amalgamated products to embed any
-- finitely generated recursively presented group in a finitely presented group.
