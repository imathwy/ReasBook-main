Primary domain: conjugacy theory for HNN extensions.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: cyclically reduced reduced words in an HNN extension and the conjugacy theorem
  describing conjugate such words by cyclic permutation and conjugation by an element of `A` or
  `B`.
- `core/canonical`: `HNNExtension.NormalWord.ReducedWord G B A`, its bridge evaluation map
  `ReducedWord.toHNNExtension`, and the group-theoretic conjugacy relation `IsConj`.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook cyclic sequence attached to a reduced HNN word is the derived list
  obtained by merging the initial base term into the terminal syllable. Cyclic permutation is
  then the canonical list-rotation relation `List.IsRotated` on that derived list, while
  conjugation by an element of the base group is expressed by the canonical embedding
  `HNNExtension.of`.

Domain sampling:
1. `HNNExtension.NormalWord.ReducedWord G B A` is mathlib's owner abstraction for reduced HNN
   words in the source stable-letter convention.
2. `ReducedWord.toHNNExtension φ` is the project bridge evaluating such a source word in
   `HNNExtension G A B φ`.
3. `IsConj` is the canonical conjugacy relation in a group.
4. `List.IsRotated` is the canonical list-level owner relation encoding cyclic permutation of the
   source-facing cyclic syllable list.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: reduced HNN words `u` and `v`;
- derived bridge data: the private cyclic syllable list obtained by absorbing the initial base
  term into the terminal syllable;
- derived source-facing notions: cyclic permutation and cyclically reducedness, expressed directly
  in terms of reduced words, the canonical rotation relation on that cyclic syllable list, and the
  cyclic boundary no-pinch condition;
- derived conclusion: equality of stable-letter lengths together with the existence of a cyclic
  permutation of `v`, an explicit terminal stable-letter sign `ε`, and a conjugator
  `z : toSubgroup B A ε` whose image in the HNN extension conjugates that cyclic permutation to
  `u.toHNNExtension φ`.
