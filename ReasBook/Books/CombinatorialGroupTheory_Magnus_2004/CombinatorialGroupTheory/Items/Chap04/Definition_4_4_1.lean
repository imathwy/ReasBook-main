Primary domain: finitely presented group properties and Markov properties from decision-problem
theory.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a property `P` of finitely presented groups, assumed invariant under
  isomorphism, together with the two textbook clauses that characterize when `P` is a Markov
  property.
- `core/canonical`: `Group.IsMarkovProperty` is the chapter owner for this abstract group-level
  notion, `IsFinitelyPresented` is mathlib's owner predicate for finite presentability,
  multiplicative equivalences `G ≃* H` are the canonical group isomorphisms, and monoid
  homomorphisms with `Function.Injective` are the source-faithful embedding data.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook phrase “`G₂` cannot be embedded in any finitely presented group with
  `P`” is expressed directly by the nonexistence of an injective homomorphism `G₂ →* H` into such
  a group `H`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Group.HasSolvableWordProblem` in Theorem `4-4-8` is the chapter's abstract group-level owner
   pattern for decision-theoretic properties, so this definition should also live in `namespace
   Group`.
2. `IsFinitelyPresented` is mathlib's owner predicate for finite presentability.
3. `IsFinitelyPresented.equiv` transports finite presentability across a group isomorphism, so the
   invariance hypothesis should be stated using `G ≃* H`.
4. The surrounding chapter states embeddings source-faithfully as homomorphisms together with
   `Function.Injective`, rather than introducing a separate wrapper object.

Primitive vs. derived:
- ambient input: only the group property `P`;
- primitive class data: preservation of `P` along multiplicative equivalences out of a finitely
  presented group, plus the two existence clauses from the textbook definition;
- derived public API: the symmetric `iff` form of invariance under finitely presented
  isomorphisms.
