-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the word-metric balls around `1` in the Cayley graph of a presentation
-- `(X; R)`, and the consequence that effective finite construction of all such balls yields a
-- solution to the word problem.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup R` is mathlib's owner for the group presented by `R`,
-- `HasSolvableWordProblem R` is the chapter owner predicate for decidability of the word problem,
-- `cayleyOneComplex R` below is the intrinsic Cayley `1`-skeleton of the presentation, and
-- `OneComplex.Subcomplex` is the chapter owner for the ball `Bₙ(C, 1)` as a genuine `1`-skeleton.
-- `bridge/view`: `wordMetricBallSubcomplex R n` is the source-facing ball inside the ambient
-- Cayley `1`-skeleton, while `WordMetricBall R n` is the derived `1`-complex carried by that
-- subcomplex.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup R` is mathlib's owner abstraction for the group with presentation `(X; R)`.
-- 2. `HasSolvableWordProblem R` from Definition `2-1-4` is the project owner predicate for the
--    conclusion of the lemma.
-- 3. `OneComplex.Subcomplex` from Lemma `3-3-8` is the chapter owner for intrinsic `1`-skeleton
--    subobjects, so the ball should be expressed as a genuine subcomplex of the Cayley graph.
-- 4. `SignedLetter.inv` and `SignedLetter.value` are the chapter owners for orientation reversal
--    and evaluation of a signed generator, so the intrinsic Cayley graph should reuse them rather
--    than keeping parallel local copies.
-- 5. `FreeGroup.norm` is the canonical owner for reduced-word length on `FreeGroup X`, so the
--    textbook metric ball is organized around that owner rather than raw list length.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the relator set `R`, the radius `n`, and the actual Cayley `1`-skeleton;
-- `wordMetricBallSubcomplex R n` is the source-facing ball object, `WordMetricBall R n` is the
-- derived `1`-complex it carries, and the extra effective data needed for Lemma `3-5-7` are only
-- a finite codable structure on the actual vertex carrier of that intrinsic ball together with the
-- computable source-facing evaluation map sending a bounded signed word to its canonical ball
-- vertex. The oriented-edge carrier of the same ball remains derived structure of the owner
-- `1`-complex, not primitive public data of the effective hypothesis.

variable [Primcodable X]

/-- Lemma 3-5-7: if every ball `Bₙ(C, 1)` in the Cayley graph of the presentation `(X; R)` has
finite, effectively constructible vertex set, then the presentation has solvable word problem. In
the owner formulation, each intrinsic ball `WordMetricBall R n` is already an actual `1`-complex,
and the effective hypothesis supplies only the vertex-side data used by the word-problem argument:
a finite codable structure on the genuine ball vertices together with the computable source-facing
evaluation map from bounded signed words into that intrinsic ball. -/
-- Proof sketch: on an input signed word `L`, work in the finite model of the radius-`L.length`
-- ball. Compare the canonical ball vertex of `L` with the canonical base vertex `1` inside that
-- finite ball. Since both points already live in the actual ball `1`-skeleton, equality of those
-- ball vertices is exactly equality of their images in `PresentedGroup R`, so `L` represents `1`
-- precisely when those two vertices agree.
