Primary domain: finite singular subcomplex decompositions inside an ambient `TwoComplex`.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a finite singular subcomplex with no loose `1`-skeleton data, together with
  the conclusion that its connected components are singular discs equipped with explicit reduced
  boundary cycles or singular spheres whose edges are all closed up by carried faces.
- `core/canonical`: `OneComplex.GeometricEdge`,
  `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected (Quiver.Symmetrify _)`,
  `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected`, `TwoComplex.EmbedsInPlane`, `TwoComplex.EmbedsInSphere`, and
  `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` are the owner predicates and carriers for the geometric ingredients.
- `bridge/view`: `Quiver.Path.CyclicPath`, `IsSimpleCycle`, and
  `IsCyclicallyReducedCycle` are the owner API for the chosen boundary cycle carried by a
  singular disc, while oriented-edge representatives of a geometric edge remain only a companion
  view for boundary traversal.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` from Proposition `3-3-5` is the owner abstraction for carried
   subcomplexes and their induced `2`-complexes.
2. `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected` from Proposition `3-4-2` is the owner predicate for simple
   connectedness of the carried `2`-complex.
3. `TwoComplex.EmbedsInPlane` and `TwoComplex.EmbedsInSphere` from Proposition `3-5-6` are the
   owner predicates for planar and spherical embeddability.
4. `OneComplex.GeometricEdge` from Definition `3-2-1` is the owner carrier for carried edges, so
   boundary-vs-interior edge data should be phrased on geometric edges rather than on oriented
   representatives.
5. `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` from Definition `3-2-4` is the owner carrier for orientation-free
   face incidence, so the incident-face API should pair naturally with geometric edges.
6. `Quiver.Path.CyclicPath`, `IsSimpleCycle`, and `IsCyclicallyReducedCycle` are the owner API
   for the explicit disc boundary cycle.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the ambient subcomplex `S` with finite carried vertices, geometric edges, and
  faces, no loose carried vertices or edges, and for a disc component its chosen boundary cycle;
- derived API: connected-component decompositions of `S`, connectedness, simple connectedness,
  simplicity and cyclic reduction of the chosen boundary cycle, and the geometric-face incidence
  conditions distinguishing disc boundary geometric edges from interior or spherical ones.

/-- Proposition 3-9-1: every singular subcomplex admits a finite component normal form in which
each component is either a singular disc with an explicit reduced boundary cycle or a singular
sphere. -/
-- Proof sketch: argue by induction on the total boundary length of the singular subcomplex.
-- Detachment decreases this complexity by splitting off repeated boundary segments, while sewing
-- up removes immediately cancellable boundary pairs. Repeating these moves until no further
-- reduction is possible yields components that are exactly reduced singular discs or singular
-- spheres.
