Primary domain: combinatorial group theory via transitive actions on integer-valued metric spaces.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an integer-valued distance bridge `d` on `V`, its source balls `S_l(v)`, and
  Behr's bounded descending-path condition `(II)`.
- `core/canonical`: `PseudoMetricSpace V`, `IsIsometricSMul G V`, `MulAction.IsPretransitive`,
  `MulAction.stabilizer`, `Relation.ReflTransGen`, and `Group.IsFinitelyPresented`.
- `bridge/view`: `integerClosedBall`, the notation `S[d](v, l)`,
  `HasBoundedDescendingPathsInBall`, and `integerClosedBall_eq_closedBall` connect the source
  integer distance data and Behr's condition `(II)` to the canonical metric closed-ball and
  relation-closure owners.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the integer-valued distance `d`, the step bound `k`, and the ambient
  group action on `V`;
- derived API: the source balls `S[d](v, l)`, the ballwise descending-path predicate
  `HasBoundedDescendingPathsInBall d k v l`, and condition `(II)`, all expressed through the
  canonical relation-closure owner `Relation.ReflTransGen`.

Domain sampling:
1. `PseudoMetricSpace` and `Metric.closedBall` are mathlib's owners for the ambient metric layer.
2. `IsIsometricSMul` is mathlib's owner predicate for distance-preserving scalar actions.
3. `MulAction.IsPretransitive` together with `MulAction.stabilizer` are mathlib's owners for the
   transitivity and vertex-stabilizer layers of the action.
4. `Relation.ReflTransGen` is mathlib's owner abstraction for a finite iterated chain of
   one-step moves, so it is the right core for the bounded descending-path condition and its
   ballwise owner predicate.

-- Proof sketch: choose a base vertex `v0` and the finite generating set obtained from the finite
-- ball of radius `k` around `v0`; then follow Behr's rewriting argument using the bounded
-- descending-path hypothesis to control relators and deduce a finite presentation of `G` from a
-- finite presentation of the stabilizer `stabilizer G v0`.
/-- Proposition 3-13-1: if `d` is an integer-valued distance whose balls `S_l(v)` are finite for
`l ≥ 1`, if `d` agrees with the ambient metric on `V`, and if the bounded descending-path
condition `(II)` holds, then any transitive isometric action of `G` on `V` has finitely presented
acting group whenever one vertex stabilizer is finitely presented. -/
