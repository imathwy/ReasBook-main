Primary domain: planar `2`-complexes, subcomplex boundaries, and the area measure attached to an
angle measure.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an angle measure on a planar `2`-complex, the induced area of a subcomplex,
  the simple-boundary condition for a subcomplex, and the hypothesis that two subcomplexes meet
  exactly along a common boundary arc.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` from Proposition `3-3-5` is the owner for carried
  subcomplexes and their union, `TwoComplex.EmbedsInPlane` from Proposition `3-5-6` is the owner
  for planarity, and `Quiver.Path.IsSimpleCycle` from Definition `3-2-4` is the owner predicate
  for simple cyclic boundaries.
- `bridge/view`: an actual common boundary arc is represented by a simple path in the ambient
  `1`-skeleton, and the intersection condition is expressed by comparing the carried vertex and
  edge data of the two subcomplexes with the support of that path.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` from Proposition `3-3-5` is the owner abstraction for the regions
   appearing in the statement, so this file should speak directly about subcomplexes and their
   canonical union.
2. `OneComplex.Subcomplex.union` and `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.union` from Proposition `3-3-5` are
   the canonical owner operations for unions of carried subcomplexes.
3. `Quiver.Path.vertices` and `Quiver.Path.edgeList` are the owner API for the support of a path,
   so the common-boundary-arc predicate should use them directly rather than duplicating a local
   support wrapper.
4. `Quiver.Path.IsSimpleCycle` from Definition `3-2-4` is already the owner predicate for a
   simple boundary cycle, so the subcomplex boundary condition should be phrased through it rather
   than by introducing a new cycle-simplicity notion.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the ambient complex `C`, the angle measure `α`, the subcomplexes `S₁` and
  `S₂`, and the witnessing simple path for the common boundary arc;
- derived API: the associated area of a subcomplex, the source-facing predicates
  `Subcomplex.HasSimpleBoundary` and `Subcomplex.IntersectsOnlyInCommonBoundaryArc`, and the
  additivity theorem for unions under those hypotheses.

/-- Proposition 3-7-5: if two subcomplexes with simple boundaries in a planar complex intersect
only in a common boundary arc, then the associated area measure is additive on their union. -/
-- Proof sketch: compare the boundary-angle contributions of `S₁`, `S₂`, and `S₁ ∪ S₂`. Along the
-- common boundary arc, complementary interior angles cancel, while the two endpoints of the arc
-- contribute the missing `2π` correction. Substituting the resulting boundary-curvature identity
-- into the definition of the associated area measure yields the claimed additivity formula.
