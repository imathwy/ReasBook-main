Primary domain: planar Cayley complexes, topological surfaces, and free products of cyclic groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a concrete Cayley-complex realization of a presentation of `G` whose Cayley
  complex embeds in a `2`-manifold.
- `core/canonical`: `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` is the owner for a Cayley-complex realization,
  `ChartedSpace 𝔼² S` is the standard local-Euclidean owner for a
  topological `2`-manifold model, and `Monoid.CoprodI` is mathlib's owner for indexed free
  products.
- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding` is the cellwise topological-realization owner
  for a `2`-complex in a surface, and `TwoComplex.EmbedsInTwoManifold` /
  `IsFreeProductOfCyclicGroups` expose the source-facing existence hypotheses and conclusions
  directly.

Domain sampling:
1. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` is the canonical chapter owner for the actual Cayley complex
   attached to a presentation.
2. `ChartedSpace 𝔼² S` is mathlib's standard local-Euclidean owner for a topological
   `2`-manifold model.
3. `Monoid.CoprodI A` is mathlib's owner for free products indexed by a family of groups, while
   `IsCyclic (A i)` is the owner predicate for cyclic factors.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the actual vertex placement together with closed-interval edge maps and
  closed-disk face maps that are topological embeddings into the ambient surface;
- derived API: the closed edge-images and face-images, their opposite-orientation invariance, and
  the source-style manifold-embeddability predicate.

-- Proof sketch: analyze the relator-root system of the given planar Cayley presentation as in the
-- text. A finite strictly quadratic connected component gives an `F`-group by Proposition
-- `3-5-4`; otherwise each component normalizes to cyclic relators, and the presentation splits as
-- a free product of cyclic groups.
