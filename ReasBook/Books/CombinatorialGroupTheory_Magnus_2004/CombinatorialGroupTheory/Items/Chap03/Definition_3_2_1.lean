-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a `1`-complex with an explicit set of vertices, an explicit set of oriented
-- edges, and a fixed-point-free orientation-reversing involution on edges.
-- `core/canonical`: mathlib's `Quiver` is the owner abstraction for directed multigraph-style
-- edge data, and `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected` on the symmetrified quiver is the owner predicate
-- for zigzag-connectedness.
-- `bridge/view`: a `1`-complex canonically induces a quiver on its vertex type by taking arrows
-- from `v` to `w` to be edges whose initial and terminal vertices are `v` and `w`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `Quiver` is mathlib's owner abstraction for directed multigraph-style edge data.
-- 2. `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected (Quiver.Symmetrify C)` is the owner predicate for connectedness
--    by zigzags in a reversible graph.
-- 3. `Quiver.RootedConnected` is the owner class for based reachability, so no extra local
--    wrapper around it belongs in the public API.
-- 4. `Digraph` is too coarse here because it forgets the edge set and cannot distinguish
--    parallel edges.
-- 5. `SimpleGraph.Dart` models oriented edges in an undirected simple graph, but the present item
--    starts from a primitive edge set rather than deriving darts from an underlying simple graph.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the vertex type, edge type, endpoint maps, and inverse-edge map; the
-- induced quiver structure and zigzag-connectedness properties are derived.
