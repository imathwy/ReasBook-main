Primary domain: small-cancellation style control of the normal closure of a relator family in a
free group.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the normal closure `N` of the relators, the source symmetrized relator family
  `R*`, the “more than one half” segment condition on reduced words, and the conclusion that `N`
  has a basis consisting of conjugates of relators.
- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.normalClosure R` is the owner for the subgroup `N`,
  `FreeGroupBasis` is the canonical owner for a chosen free basis of `N`, `CyclicWord X` is the
  chapter owner for reduced relators modulo cyclic permutation, `CyclicWord.toConjClasses` is the
  owner bridge from a cyclic word to the represented conjugacy class in the free group,
  `List.IsInfix` and `CyclicWord.HasPart` are the owner predicates for consecutive segments
  of canonical reduced and cyclically reduced words, and
  `IsConj` is the owner for conjugacy in the ambient free group.
- `bridge/view`: the source family `R*` is modeled as the set of cyclic words whose represented
  conjugacy class comes from a relator in `R` or its inverse, and the long-segment condition
  compares a linear segment of `w.toWord` with a cyclic segment of one of those symmetrized
  relators, using the chapter owner predicates for linear and cyclic occurrence.

Domain sampling:
1. `Subgroup.normalClosure R` is the canonical owner for the subgroup generated normally by the
   relators.
2. `FreeGroupBasis` is the canonical mathlib owner for a chosen free basis of a subgroup.
3. `List.IsInfix` from mathlib is the owner predicate for a segment of a reduced word.
4. `CyclicWord.HasPart` from Proposition `1-7-9` is the existing source-facing owner for a
   cyclic segment of a reduced cyclic word.
5. `CyclicWord.toConjClasses` from Definition `1-4-17` is the bridge from a reduced cyclic word
   to the represented conjugacy class.
6. `IsConj` is mathlib's owner predicate for conjugacy, so the conclusion should speak directly
   in that owner relation rather than through an explicit conjugator witness.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the relator set `R`, a nontrivial element `w` of `Subgroup.normalClosure R`,
  and the existence of a segment in `w.toWord` longer than half the cyclic length of some
  symmetrized relator from `R*`, expressed through `List.IsInfix` and `CyclicWord.HasPart`;
- derived API: the existence of a basis of `Subgroup.normalClosure R` whose members are conjugates
  of relators from `R`.

/-- Proposition 3-11-2: if every nontrivial element of the relator subgroup has a reduced-word
segment longer than half the cyclic length of some element of the source symmetrized relator
family `R*`, then the normal closure `N = Subgroup.normalClosure R` has a basis consisting of
conjugates of elements of `R`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the half-overlap hypothesis to show that the collection of conjugates of
-- relators obtained by repeatedly shortening nontrivial elements of `N` is Nielsen reduced.
-- Then apply the Chapter `1` Nielsen basis criterion to that generating family inside
-- `Subgroup.normalClosure R`, yielding a basis whose elements remain conjugates of relators.
