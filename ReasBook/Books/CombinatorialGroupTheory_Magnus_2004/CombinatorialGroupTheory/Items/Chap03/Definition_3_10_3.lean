Primary domain: finite list-valued Peiffer rewrites in a group.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the second Peiffer transformation replacing an adjacent pair `(a, b)` by
  `(a * b * a⁻¹, a)`.
- `core/canonical`: `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap` from Definition `3-10-2` is the chapter
  owner relation for this adjacent conjugating rewrite.
- `bridge/view`: the displayed textbook second-kind formula is exactly that owner relation, so the
  file recalls the canonical declaration directly instead of introducing a parallel local
  predicate.

Domain sampling:
1. `List G` is mathlib's owner abstraction for finite ordered sequences.
2. `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap` is the project owner for the adjacent conjugating rewrite.
3. `List.length` is the first owner-side invariant of such a rewrite.
4. `List.prod` is the natural group-valued aggregate invariant of a Peiffer move.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the owner relation `IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap` on the two lists;
- derived API: the owner-side invariants `length_eq_of_isAdjacentConjugatingSwap` and
  `prod_eq_of_isAdjacentConjugatingSwap`.

/- Definition 3-10-3: the displayed second-kind Peiffer transformation is the chapter owner
relation `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap`. Its basic invariants are part of that owner API, so
this file recalls the canonical declaration directly. -/
