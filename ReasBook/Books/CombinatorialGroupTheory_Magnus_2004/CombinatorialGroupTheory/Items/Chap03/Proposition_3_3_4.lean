Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a connected `2`-complex `C`, a base vertex `v : C.skeleton`, a subgroup
`H ≤ π(C, v)`, and a connected covering `2`-complex whose induced map on fundamental groups
identifies the covering group with `H`.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.Hom`, extending the chapter owner `OneComplex.Hom` on the
  `1`-skeleton, is the source-faithful owner for maps of `2`-complexes,
  `TwoComplex.Hom.IsCoveringMap` is the owner abstraction for coverings of `2`-complexes,
  `Quiver.Prefunctor.IsCovering` for `φ.toPrefunctor` is the canonical owner for the
  `1`-skeleton covering data reused by that class, and `CategoryTheory.Functor.mapEnd` is the
  owner API for the induced map on based fundamental groups.
- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.Hom.piFunctor` and
  `TwoComplex.Hom.inducedFundamentalGroupHomOver` are the induced functor on fundamental
  groupoids and its based vertex-group specialization, while `TwoComplex.BoundaryStar` and
  `TwoComplex.Hom.mapBoundaryStar` express the `2`-cell lifting condition using the existing
  path-based `BoundaryPath` owner API.

Domain sampling:
1. `OneComplex.Hom` from Proposition `3-3-1` is the chapter owner for morphisms of `1`-complexes.
2. `TwoComplex.BoundaryPath` is the project owner for a face corner based at a chosen vertex.
3. `Quiver.Prefunctor.IsCovering` is the canonical owner predicate for the `1`-skeleton part of a
   covering, accessed here through `OneComplex.Hom.toPrefunctor`.
4. `OneComplex.Hom.pi1Functor` and `CategoryTheory.Functor.mapEnd` give the chapter/mathlib owner
   pattern for passing from a map of path groupoids to the induced homomorphism on based
   fundamental groups.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the skeleton morphism, the face map, and compatibility saying that mapped face
  boundary loops are boundary loops of the image face; for coverings, the primitive extra data is
  the existing `1`-skeleton covering owner together with the bijective lifting condition on based
  boundary paths over each vertex;
- derived API: the induced functor on `2`-dimensional path classes, the induced homomorphism on
  fundamental groups, and injectivity for covering maps.

/-- Proposition 3-3-4: for any subgroup `H ≤ π(C, v)` of the fundamental group of a connected
`2`-complex `C`, there exists a connected covering `2`-complex `C' → C` with a chosen vertex `v'`
over `v` whose induced homomorphism `π(C', v') → π(C, v)` has image exactly `H`; injectivity is
the canonical consequence of the covering-map owner. -/
-- Proof sketch: first build the covering of the `1`-skeleton corresponding to the subgroup of
-- `π(C.skeleton, v)` from Proposition `3-3-2`. Then attach a `2`-cell over each lifted boundary
-- loop of a face of `C`, obtaining a connected `2`-complex covering whose induced map on
-- fundamental groups has image `H`; injectivity follows from covering-space lifting.
