Primary domain: planar embeddings of `2`-complexes and the area measure attached to an angle
measure.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an ordered family of oriented faces whose nonempty prefix unions bound simple
  closed curves in a fixed planar embedding, together with the resulting area formula for the
  covered subcomplex.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` is the owner for intrinsic subcomplex data,
  `TwoComplex.AngleMeasure` together with `AngleMeasure.associatedAreaMeasure` is the owner for
  area attached to subcomplexes, `Subcomplex.ContainsGeometricFace` is the canonical geometric-face
  view of a subcomplex, and `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.geometricFaceUnion` is the owner for
  the corresponding ambient planar image.
- `bridge/view`: the ordered list contributes canonical prefix subcomplexes inside `S`, while
  `TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundedBySimpleClosedCurve` below is the source-facing simple-closed-
  curve predicate for the planar image of a subcomplex.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` from Proposition `3-3-5` is the chapter owner for the intrinsic
   `2`-dimensional object; this corollary should talk about `S : Subcomplex K`, not a local
   wrapper around its face data.
2. `TwoComplex.AngleMeasure.associatedAreaMeasure` from Proposition `3-7-5` is already the owner
   for the area of a subcomplex, so the main statement should use it directly.
3. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.geometricFaceUnion` from Proposition `3-5-5`, together with
   `Subcomplex.ContainsGeometricFace` from Proposition `3-3-5`, is already the owner for the
   planar image of a subcomplex, so this file should not keep a parallel `subcomplexImage`
   definition.
4. `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` from Definition `3-2-4` is the owner for orientation-free faces,
   so the summand expression should use the canonical quotient notation rather than a verbose raw
   constructor term.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the ambient complex `K`, its planar embedding `embedding`, the angle measure
  `α`, the target subcomplex `S`, and the ordered face list `faces`;
- derived API: the inverse-closed membership relation attached to `faces`, the canonical prefix
  subcomplexes inside `S`, their planar images in the embedding, and the resulting
  simple-closed-curve predicate.

/-- Corollary 3-7-6: if a subcomplex `S` of a planar complex `K` is the union of an ordered list
of faces `D₁, …, Dₙ`, every nonempty initial union `D₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ Dᵢ` is bounded by a simple closed
curve in a chosen planar embedding, and `faceArea` records the associated area of each listed
geometric face via the canonical one-face subcomplexes of `S`, then `α(S)` is the sum of the
areas of the listed faces. -/
-- Proof sketch: induct on the list of faces. The simple-closed-boundary hypothesis identifies
-- each nonempty prefix union as a planar disc-like region, so adjoining the last face changes the
-- area by exactly the area of that face as identified by `hfaceArea`; iterating yields the
-- required finite sum formula.
