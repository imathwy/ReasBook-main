Primary domain: special linear groups over localizations of `ℤ` and Bass-Serre amalgams.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the congruence subgroup `Γ₀(p) ≤ SL(2, ℤ)`, the two adjacent-vertex
  stabilizers inside `SL(2, ℤ[1/p])`, and the claim that `SL(2, ℤ[1/p])` is their amalgamated
  free product over the common edge stabilizer.
- `core/canonical`: `SL(2, ℤ)`, `Gamma0 p`, `SL(2, Localization.Away (p : ℤ))`, `Subgroup`, and
  the chapter owner API `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductComparison`.
- `bridge/view`: the integral copy of `SL(2, ℤ)` inside the localization, the diagonal element
  `diag(1, p)` in the ambient general linear group, the induced conjugation of
  `SL(2, ℤ[1/p])`, and the resulting ambient image of `Γ₀(p)`.

Domain sampling:
1. `SL(2, R)` from `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup` is the canonical owner for determinant-one `2 × 2`
   matrices over a commutative ring `R`.
2. `Gamma0 p` from mathlib is the canonical owner for the subgroup of `SL(2, ℤ)` cut out by the
   condition that the lower-left entry is `0 mod p`.
3. `Localization.Away (p : ℤ)` is the canonical localization model for the source ring `ℤ[1/p]`.
4. `ConjAct.toConjAct` is the canonical owner for conjugation by an ambient invertible element,
   so the adjacent vertex stabilizer should be expressed as the `diag(1, p)`-conjugate of the
   integral stabilizer rather than via an entrywise duplicate embedding.
5. `Subgroup.map` and `Subgroup.range` are the canonical subgroup owners for the integral vertex
  stabilizer, its `diag(1, p)`-conjugate, and the ambient image of `Γ₀(p)`.
6. Proposition `3-12-5` already exposes `Subgroup.amalgamatedProduct` and
   `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductComparison` as the chapter owner API for a two-factor amalgam.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the canonical congruence subgroup `Gamma0 p ≤ SL(2, ℤ)`;
- derived API: the integral vertex stabilizer, its `diag(1, p)`-conjugate adjacent stabilizer,
  the ambient image of `Gamma0 p`, its distinct conjugate copy inside the adjacent vertex
  stabilizer, the identification of the integral copy with the subgroup intersection, and the
  canonical amalgamated-product comparison map supplied by Proposition `3-12-5`.
