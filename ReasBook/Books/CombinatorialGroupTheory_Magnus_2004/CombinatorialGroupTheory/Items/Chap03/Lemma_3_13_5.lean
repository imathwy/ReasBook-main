Primary domain: Behr-style rewriting for group actions on an integer-valued metric space.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a group action of `G` on `V`, a basepoint `o`, a generator alphabet `X` with
  distinguished subset `X₀`, an integer-valued distance, and the three bounded-word /
  bounded-descent hypotheses used in Behr's rewriting argument.
- `core/canonical`: `[MulAction G V]` is mathlib's owner abstraction for the action, `List X` is
  the source owner for finite positive words, `List.map` together with `List.prod` is the
  canonical concrete evaluation API for such words in the ambient group, and Proposition `3-13-1`
  already provides the owner abstractions `integerClosedBall` and
  `HasBoundedDescendingPathsInBall` for the descending-path condition.
- `bridge/view`: the two helper predicates below express the two bounded-word hypotheses against
  the canonical action.

Domain sampling:
1. `[MulAction G V]` is the mathlib owner abstraction for the action, so the lemma should live
   directly over the instance rather than a second packaged graph structure.
2. `List.map` and `List.prod` are the canonical concrete owner API for evaluating a positive
   `List X` word in `G`; equivalently, this is the `FreeMonoid.lift` evaluation specialized to
   the list model of `FreeMonoid`.
3. `integerClosedBall` together with the notation `S[d](o, l)` is the chapter owner for the
   closed ball `S_l(o)`.
4. `HasBoundedDescendingPathsInBall` is the chapter owner for Behr's bounded descending-path
   hypothesis in a fixed ball.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the action of `G` on `V`, the generator interpretation `X → G`, the
  distinguished subset `X₀ ⊆ X`, the step bound `k`, the basepoint `o`, and the distance
  function `d`;
- derived API: bounded word realizations of short metric steps, bounded distinguished words for
  stabilizer loops, and the resulting correction-word existence theorem.

/-- Lemma 3-13-5: assume Behr's bounded descending-path condition in the ball about `o`, together
with bounded generator realizations of short metric steps and bounded distinguished word
representatives for stabilizer loops. Then whenever `u` is obtained from `v` by the positive word
`g`, there is a correction word whose total product cancels `g`, whose tail
`correction.drop (|g| * k)` lies in `X₀`, and whose prefixes keep the intermediate translates of
`u` inside the radius `max {d(o, v), d(o, u)}`. -/
