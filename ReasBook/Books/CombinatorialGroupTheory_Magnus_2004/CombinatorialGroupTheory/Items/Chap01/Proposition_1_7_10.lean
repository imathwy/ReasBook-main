-- Layer triage for Proposition 1-7-10:
-- `source-facing`: finite strictly quadratic systems of signed cyclic words, deletion of one
-- adjacent cancellation part `l l⁻¹`, and the Whitehead-graph component count `k(S)`.
-- `core/canonical`: `SignedLetter α` from Proposition `1-7-8`, `Cycle (SignedLetter α)` for the
-- unreduced cyclic-word model, and the reduced-system owner `CyclicWord.Finset.cycleCount` from
-- Proposition `1-7-9`.
-- `bridge/view`: the raw `Cycle` support and edge formulas from Proposition `1-7-11` are reused
-- only because this proposition is genuinely about the unreduced side of the cancellation move;
-- no extra local reduced-system packaging is kept here.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `SignedLetter α` from Proposition `1-7-8` is the shared signed-letter vocabulary for
--    Section 7 cyclic-word constructions.
-- 2. `Cycle.whiteheadEdges` from Proposition `1-7-11` is the raw one-word edge formula reused
--    only because this proposition is stated for unreduced cyclic systems.
-- 3. `Cycle.whiteheadSupport` from Proposition `1-7-11` is the corresponding raw support
--    construction, so the system support is likewise a finite union.
-- 4. `CyclicWord.Finset.cycleCount` from Proposition `1-7-9` is the chapter owner once a system
--    is already reduced, so this file should avoid keeping a parallel reduced-system bridge API.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data here are only `S`, `S'`, and the signed letter `l`; the Whitehead edges of
-- one word are reused from Proposition `1-7-11`, while system strict quadraticity, the
-- Whitehead graph, and one-step cancellation deletion are derived directly on the raw
-- finite-system owner `Cycle.Finset`.

/-- Proposition 1-7-10: if `S` is a finite strictly quadratic system of cyclic words, and `S'` is
obtained from `S` by deleting a part `l l⁻¹`, then `k(S') = k(S) - 1` provided that the
exceptional word `l l⁻¹` is not itself a member of `S`. The source hypothesis that `S` is not
reduced is omitted from the interface because it already follows from the deletion hypothesis. -/
-- Proof sketch: compare the Whitehead graph attached to `S` with the one attached to `S'`.
-- Outside the exceptional case, deleting `l l⁻¹` replaces the local Whitehead-graph contribution
-- of that adjacent inverse pair by a single arc, so the number of connected components drops by
-- exactly one.
