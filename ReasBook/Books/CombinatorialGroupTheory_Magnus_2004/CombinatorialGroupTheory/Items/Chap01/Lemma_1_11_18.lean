/- Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the two-step Section `11` reduction step with endpoint syllables `u₀`, `u₁`,
  bridge term `a₀`, decompositions `uᵢ = pᵢ⁻¹ * hᵢ * qᵢ`, and the textbook bound by the middle
  product `u₀ * a₀ * u₁`.
- `core/canonical`: the amalgamated-product owner `Monoid.PushoutI φ`, the chosen normal-form
  data `NormalWord.Transversal φ`, the owner length `syllableLength d`, and the Section `11`
  owner predicate `IsSection11ReductionChain`.
- `bridge/view`: the specialization `n = 1` of the non-strict comparison clause already packaged
  by `IsSection11ReductionChain`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.PushoutI` is the chapter/mathlib owner abstraction for the amalgamated product.
2. `Monoid.PushoutI.NormalWord.Transversal` is the canonical chosen normal-form data.
3. `Monoid.PushoutI.syllableLength` from Definition `1-11-2` is the chapter owner for the Section
   `11` length.
4. `Monoid.PushoutI.IsSection11ReductionChain` from Lemma `1-11-3` is the canonical owner
   abstraction for the two-sided length comparisons in a finite Section `11` reduction chain.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data are the two-step chain entries `u`, `a`, `p`, `h`, `q`, the source
comparison relation `A_lt`, and the owner predicate `IsSection11ReductionChain d A_lt u a p h q`.
The max-bound on the two endpoint syllable lengths is derived API from that owner predicate, so it
should be stated directly as its `n = 1` consequence rather than through an ad hoc subset `W` and
middle element `g`. -/

/-- Lemma 1-11-18: in the two-step Section `11` reduction-chain situation, the larger of the two
endpoint syllable lengths is bounded by the syllable length of the middle product
`u₀ * a₀ * u₁`. -/
