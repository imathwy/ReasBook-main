-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a finite strictly quadratic word system in `FreeGroup X`, its Whitehead graph,
-- and the textbook conclusions "connected", "minimal", and "contains all generators".
-- `core/canonical`: `IsStrictlyQuadraticSet`, the owner namespace `FreeGroup.Finset` with
-- `totalLength`, `sigmaGraph`, `IsMinimal`, and `ContainsAllGenerators`,
-- `(wordIncidenceGraph basis (S : Set (FreeGroup X))).Connected`, `Finset.image`,
-- `FreeGroup.toWord`, `SimpleGraph.fromRel`, and `SimpleGraph.Connected`.
-- `bridge/view`: generator occurrence in reduced words translates Whitehead-graph connectedness
-- into the canonical word-incidence-graph connectedness predicate and the other source predicates
-- used below.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `IsStrictlyQuadraticSet` from Proposition `1-7-6` is the chapter owner predicate for the
--    strict quadraticity of a finite set of free-group words, so this file reuses it directly.
-- 2. `wordIncidenceGraph basis` from Proposition `1-7-4` is the owner connectedness
--    construction for finite word systems, so the first theorem should conclude directly in that
--    owner form.
-- 3. In the source-facing Whitehead-graph formulation for finite-rank bases, the vertex set is
--    the full signed basis `X ± 1`, not merely the finite support of `S`, so the graph owner
--    below carries the weakest corresponding ambient hypothesis `[Finite X]`.
-- 4. `FreeGroup.Finset` is the natural owner namespace for finite free-group word systems in this
--    chapter, so the Whitehead graph, full-support predicate, and orbitwise minimality predicate
--    live there rather than as new bare globals.
-- 5. `basisLetterOccurs` and `generatorFiber` from Proposition `1-7-4` are the chapter owner
--    occurrence APIs for basis letters in a word system, so the full-support predicate below is
--    stated directly through them instead of rebuilding a parallel occurrence relation.
--
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data are only the finite system `S : Finset (FreeGroup X)` and the reduced
-- word of each element. Strict quadraticity, word-incidence connectedness, and letter occurrence in
-- the system are reused owner notions; the Whitehead graph and automorphic minimality are derived
-- from them.

/-- The Whitehead-style signed-letter graph associated to a finite system of reduced words. Its
vertices are the signed generators `X ± 1`, and an edge joins `a` to `b⁻¹` when the consecutive
pair `(a, b)` appears in the canonical reduced word of some element of `S`. Because this source-
facing graph uses the full ambient signed basis as its vertex set, it is only exposed under the
finite-rank hypothesis `[Finite X]`. -/

/-- Proposition 1-7-8 (1): if the Whitehead graph `Σ(S)` of a finite strictly quadratic system is
connected, then the system `S` is connected. -/
-- Proof sketch: a path in the signed-letter graph records a chain of generators shared by
-- successive words, and that chain lifts to a path in the canonical word-incidence graph.

/-- Proposition 1-7-8 (2): if a finite strictly quadratic system has connected Whitehead graph,
then it is minimal in its automorphic orbit. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `S` were not minimal, Whitehead's reduction criterion would provide a
-- length-reducing Whitehead move. Strict quadraticity forces `Σ(S)` to be a union of cycles, and
-- connectedness rules out the small cut cardinalities needed for a length decrease.

/-- Proposition 1-7-8 (3): if the Whitehead graph `Σ(S)` is connected, then every generator of the
ambient basis occurs in `S`. -/
-- Proof sketch: a generator missing from `S` would contribute isolated signed vertices to
-- `Σ(S)`, contradicting connectedness.
