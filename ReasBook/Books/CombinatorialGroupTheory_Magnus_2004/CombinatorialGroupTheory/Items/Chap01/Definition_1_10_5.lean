noncomputable section

universe u

variable {X : Type u}

/- Definition 1-10-5 lies in Fox calculus for free groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the coordinate Fox derivative with respect to a generator `x`.
- `core/canonical`: the chapter owner map `foxTriangularRepresentation X` and its coordinate
  `foxUniversalDifferential`.
- `bridge/view`: the explicit signed-letter formula `foxLetterDerivative` and the word-sum formula
  `foxDerivative_mk_eq_sum`.

Domain sampling:
1. `FreeGroup.lift` is mathlib's owner constructor for multiplicative maps out of a free group.
2. `FreeGroup.lift_mk` is the canonical word-level formula for such owner maps on displayed words.
3. `foxTriangularRepresentation` is the chapter owner Fox-calculus representation built from that
   constructor, and `foxUniversalDifferential` is its canonical differential coordinate.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive chapter owner data is `foxUniversalDifferential`; the source-facing coordinate is
its ordinary evaluation at `x`, while the explicit signed-letter and displayed-word formulas on
`SignedLetter X` and `List (SignedLetter X)` are derived API. This file should therefore avoid
owning a second public Fox-derivative owner parallel to that canonical differential.

-- Proof sketch: induct on the list `word`; the empty word contributes `0`, and the inductive step
-- pulls out the first-letter term and multiplies the inductive sum for the suffix by the prefix
-- monomial represented by that first letter.
