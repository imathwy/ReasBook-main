/- Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the textbook witness `u = p⁻¹ * h * p` with `syllableLength d h = 1`, together
  with the shortening hypothesis for conjugation by a base element.
- `core/canonical`: the amalgamated-product owner `Monoid.PushoutI φ`, the chosen normal-form
  data `NormalWord.Transversal φ`, the derived owner length `syllableLength d`, the amalgamated
  subgroup `(base φ).range`, and the owner subset `shortSyllableConjugates d`.
- `bridge/view`: the source statement names a specific length-one conjugacy witness, while the
  chapter's owner abstraction packages such elements as membership in `shortSyllableConjugates d`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.PushoutI` is the owner abstraction for the amalgamated product.
2. `Monoid.PushoutI.NormalWord.Transversal` is the canonical chosen normal-form data.
3. `Monoid.PushoutI.shortSyllableConjugates` from Lemma `1-11-14` is the owner subset for
   conjugates of elements of syllable length at most `1`.
4. `Monoid.PushoutI.syllableLength_eq_zero_iff_mem_base_range` from Definition `1-11-2` is the
   canonical translation between syllable length `0` and membership in the amalgamated subgroup.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive source data are still the explicit conjugacy witness `u = p⁻¹ * h * p` and the
length-one hypothesis on `h`. Membership in `shortSyllableConjugates d` for `u` and for its base
conjugate is derived owner-side API, so this file reuses that owner abstraction through thin
bridge lemmas instead of introducing a parallel wrapper.

-- Proof sketch: the shorter base conjugate is still in `shortSyllableConjugates d` by the
-- preceding owner bridge. If the conjugating word `p` had positive syllable length, the textbook
-- normal-form calculation would keep `(base φ a)⁻¹ * u * base φ a` reduced with the same
-- syllable length as `u`. Hence strict shortening forces `p` to lie in the base subgroup, so `u`
-- itself already has syllable length `1`; the shorter base conjugate then has syllable length
-- `0`, and `syllableLength_eq_zero_iff_mem_base_range` turns that into membership in
-- `(base φ).range`.
/-- Lemma 1-11-10: if an amalgamated-product element `u` is a conjugate `p⁻¹ * h * p` of a
syllable-length-one element `h`, and conjugating `u` by a base element `a` strictly shortens its
syllable length, then `u` itself has syllable length `1` and that base conjugate lies in the
amalgamated subgroup. -/
