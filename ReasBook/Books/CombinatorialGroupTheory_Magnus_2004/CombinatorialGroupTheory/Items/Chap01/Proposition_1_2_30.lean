Primary domain: conjugacy growth in free groups measured by reduced-word length.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the basis-relative word-length statement for a free group with chosen basis.
- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroup.norm` on the canonical `FreeGroup ι` model.
- `bridge/view`: `FreeGroupBasis.repr` transports the source-facing formulation to that owner
  statement.

Domain sampling:
1. `FreeGroup.norm` is the owner reduced-word length function.
2. `FreeGroupBasis.repr` is the canonical equivalence from an abstract free group with chosen basis
   to the concrete `FreeGroup` model.
3. `commute_map_iff` is the owner transport lemma for commutation through the basis equivalence.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: elements `u w` and the hypothesis `¬ Commute u w`;
- derived API: the basis-level formulation obtained by transporting the canonical `FreeGroup`
  statement through `b.repr`.

/-- Proposition 1-2-30 on the canonical free-group model: if `u` and `w` do not commute, then
there is an integer from which onward the reduced-word lengths of the conjugates
`w^{-m} * u * w^m` form a strictly increasing sequence. -/
-- Layer: core/canonical owner statement on `FreeGroup ι`.
-- Proof sketch: first conjugate `w` to a cyclically reduced element, which does not change the
-- reduced-word lengths of the conjugates up to a bounded shift. For sufficiently large positive
-- powers, enough of the initial and terminal copies of `w` survive free reduction in
-- `w^{-m} * u * w^m`, so each successive conjugation by `w` strictly increases the reduced-word
-- length. If no such tail existed, the eventual periodicity argument from the textbook would force
-- `u` and `w` to commute, contradicting the hypothesis.
