-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the contrast between the cardinalities of `Aut(F)` and the subgroup
-- `Aut_f(F)` attached to a countably infinite basis `basis : FreeGroupBasis X F`.
-- `core/canonical`: `MulAut F`, the chosen-basis owner `FreeGroupBasis X F`, and the basis-owned
-- finite-support subgroup `basis.finiteMovedSubgroup`.
-- `bridge/view`: Proposition `1-4-2` identifies `Aut_f(F)` with that owner subgroup, while
-- permutations of the basis index type transport through `basis.repr` into `MulAut F` for the
-- uncountability argument.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `FreeGroupBasis X F` in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/FreeGroup/IsFreeGroup` is the owner
--    abstraction for a chosen free basis of `F`.
-- 2. `MulAut F` is the canonical automorphism group of `F`.
-- 3. `FreeGroupBasis.finiteMovedSubgroup` from Proposition `1-4-2` is the chapter owner for the
--    finite-support subgroup on a chosen basis.
-- 4. `elementaryNielsenAutomorphismSubgroup_eq_finiteMovedSubgroup` is the source-to-owner bridge
--    identifying `Aut_f(F)` with that finite-support subgroup, and `basis.repr` together with
--    `freeGroupCongr` gives the canonical permutation action used below.
-- Primitive/derived split:
-- the primitive public data are the ambient group `F` and an explicit basis
-- `basis : FreeGroupBasis X F`; the finite-support subgroup `basis.finiteMovedSubgroup` and the
-- source-facing subgroup `basis.elementaryNielsenAutomorphismSubgroup` are derived owner-level
-- constructions, while infinitude and countability of `X` enter only in the cardinality theorems.

-- Proof sketch: the canonical map
-- `fun σ : Equiv.Perm X ↦ (basis.repr.trans (freeGroupCongr σ)).trans basis.repr.symm`
-- injects the symmetric group on the basis index type into `MulAut F`, and the permutation group
-- of an infinite set is uncountable.

/-- The basis-owned finite-support subgroup is countable when the basis index type is countable. -/
-- Proof sketch: an element of `basis.finiteMovedSubgroup` is determined by a finite subset of the
-- countable basis index type together with a permutation on that finite support,
-- so the subgroup is a countable union of finite-symmetry data.

/-- Remark 1-4-3: if a free group has a countably infinite basis, then its full automorphism group
is uncountable, while the subgroup `Aut_f(F)` attached to that basis is countable. -/
-- Proof sketch: embed the symmetric group on the basis index type into `MulAut F` to obtain
-- uncountability, and pass from the canonical finite-support subgroup
-- `basis.finiteMovedSubgroup` back to `Aut_f(F)` using Proposition `1-4-2`.
