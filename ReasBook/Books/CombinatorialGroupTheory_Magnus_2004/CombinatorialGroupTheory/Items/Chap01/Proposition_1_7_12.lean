-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: minimal strictly quadratic cyclic words together with the Section 7 counted
-- attached-transformation sequences.
-- `core/canonical`: `CyclicWord X`, its canonical length function, the canonical cyclic-word
-- action `CyclicWord.map`, the owner specialization `specializeAtOne` from Proposition `1-7-11`,
-- and `Relation.ReflTransGen` as the owner of finite step sequences.
-- `bridge/view`: the regular one-word step is the singleton specialization of the set-level
-- attached Nielsen move from Proposition `1-7-9`, while singular steps directly use the owner
-- specialization operation from Proposition `1-7-11` together with the explicit occurrence
-- condition on the specialized generator.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `AttachedElementaryNielsenTransformation` from Proposition `1-7-9` is the chapter owner
--    pattern for regular attached transformations on cyclic-word sets; the counted step relation
--    below reuses it through singleton sets.
-- 2. `CyclicWord.specializeAtOne` and `CyclicWord.IsMinimalStrictlyQuadratic` from Proposition
--    `1-7-11`
--    provide the chapter owner specialization language and the main single-word hypothesis.
-- 3. `specializeAtOne_length_eq_sub_two_or_sub_four` from Proposition `1-7-11` is the
--    chapter's exact single-word length-drop theorem reused at the singular step.
-- 4. `Relation.ReflTransGen` from mathlib is the canonical owner for finite transformation
--    sequences.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive Section 7 data are the regular singleton attached move and the owner
-- specialization `specializeAtOne`, assembled into the one-step relation
-- `AttachedTransformationStep`. The counted sequence relation then reuses the same primitive data
-- with the singular-step count adjoined before applying `Relation.ReflTransGen`.

/-- One attached transformation of a reduced cyclic word either applies a regular attached
elementary Nielsen transformation in the singleton-word system, or applies the singular
specialization at a generator occurring in the source word. -/

/-- Proposition 1-7-12: if `q` is a minimal strictly quadratic cyclic word and `q'` is obtained
from `q` by a Section 7 attached-transformation sequence containing exactly one singular
transformation, then the cyclic length drops by `2` or by `4`. -/
-- Proof sketch: factor the unique singular step from the counted `Relation.ReflTransGen` chain.
-- The regular attached steps on the two sides preserve minimal strict quadraticity and cyclic
-- length, by the singleton-word specialization of Proposition `1-7-9` together with the
-- minimality input from Proposition `1-7-11`. The regular tail after the singular step is thus
-- controlled internally by the Section 7 owner results, so no endpoint minimality hypothesis is
-- needed in the public statement. The singular step is then the canonical specialization at one
-- generator occurring in the source word, so Proposition `1-7-11` gives a length drop of `2` or
-- `4`.
