Primary domain: annular small-cancellation `R`-diagrams in the conjugacy theorem.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a reduced annular `R`-diagram with chosen outer and inner boundary cycles, the
  boundary-arc exclusion hypotheses on both boundary components, and the existence of one region
  meeting both boundary components.
- `core/canonical`: `GroupDiagram F` is the owner of the labelled diagram,
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding M.source 𝔼²` with `IsPlanarMap` is the owner of the planar
  realization, `GroupDiagram.IsRDiagram` and `GroupDiagram.IsReduced` are the diagram hypotheses,
  `IsBoundaryCycle` is the owner of the chosen outer and inner boundary cycles,
  `BoundaryCycleIntersectionLongerThanHalfRelator`, `RegionMeetsBothBoundaryCycles`, and
  `HasAnnularBoundaryCycles` from Lemma `5-5-1` are the owner APIs for the boundary-arc
  exclusion, crossing-region, and annular-boundary data, and `boundaryInteriorEdgeCount` is the
  owner of the source quantity `i(D)`.
- `bridge/view`: `GroupDiagram.AnnularRDiagram` from Lemma `5-5-1` is the concrete `FreeGroup X`
  specialization of this owner package, so at the present basis-general level `F` the theorem
  should stay on the intrinsic owner data `embedding.HasAnnularBoundaryCycles σ τ` rather than
  introduce a second annular wrapper.
  No additional owner is needed here; the theorem should expose its two
  source conclusions directly in the owner APIs `RegionMeetsBothBoundaryCycles` and
  `boundaryInteriorEdgeCount`.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryCycle` from Definition `5-4-2` is the chapter owner for
   the chosen boundary components `σ` and `τ`.
2. `GroupPresentation.HasLongSymmetrizedRelatorPart` from Proposition `3-11-2` is the canonical
   owner of the source phrase “`> 1 / 2 R`”.
3. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.boundaryInteriorEdgeCount` from Definition `5-2-8` is the
   chapter owner for the interior-edge count `i(D)`.
4. `BoundaryCycleIntersectionLongerThanHalfRelator` and
   `RegionMeetsBothBoundaryCycles` from Theorem `5-5-3`, together with
   `HasAnnularBoundaryCycles` from Lemma `5-5-1`, already package the annular-boundary geometry
   needed here, so this file should reuse them rather than restating the same segment-level data.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the basis `basis`, relator set `R`, diagram `M`, planar embedding
  `embedding`, chosen boundary cycles `σ` and `τ`, the small-cancellation case, reducedness and
  `R`-diagram hypotheses, the two boundary-arc exclusion hypotheses, and one crossing region;
- derived API: the two atomic theorem-level consequences asserting that every region meets both
  boundary cycles and that every region has interior-edge count at most two.

-- Proof sketch: start with a region meeting both boundary components, cut the annular diagram
-- along a boundary-to-boundary segment of that region, and apply the curvature estimate from
-- Theorem `4-3` to the resulting disc. Greendlinger's lemma rules out the exceptional case, and
-- the remaining degree computation propagates outward through adjacent regions; if islands remain,
-- remove one and conclude by induction on the number of regions.
/-- Theorem 5-5-5: if `R` satisfies either `C'(1 / 6)` or `C'(1 / 4)` together with `T(4)`, and
`M` is a reduced annular `R`-diagram whose outer and inner boundary cycles satisfy the source
boundary-arc exclusion hypotheses, then the existence of one region meeting both boundary
components forces every region to meet both boundary cycles. -/
