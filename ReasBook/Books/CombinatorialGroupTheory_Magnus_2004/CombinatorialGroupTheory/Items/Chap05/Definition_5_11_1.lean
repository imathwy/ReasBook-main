-- Primary domain: normal forms in free products with amalgamation.
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a normal form of one fixed nontrivial element in the amalgamated product,
-- recorded as a reduced alternating word that evaluates to that element.
-- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong e` for the ambient amalgamated product,
-- `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.Reduced` for the source reduced-word predicate,
-- `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.ofWord e` for evaluation of a word in the amalgamated
-- product, and `Monoid.PushoutI.syllableLength` for the chosen-transversal owner length on the
-- ambient pushout.
-- `bridge/view`: the textbook phrase “normal form of `w`” is the conjunction that the source
-- reduced word represents the chosen element `w`; no second word owner is introduced.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong e` is the chapter-facing owner for a two-factor
--    amalgamated product.
-- 2. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.Reduced e` already encodes exactly the source condition
--    that successive syllables come from different factors and that syllables from the
--    amalgamated subgroup are allowed only in the length-one case.
-- 3. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.ofWord e` is the canonical evaluation map from a reduced
--    factor word to the represented element of the amalgamated product.
-- 4. `Monoid.PushoutI.syllableLength` is the chapter's canonical owner for the chosen-transversal
--    normal-form length, and the source length here differs from it only by the length-one
--    convention for nontrivial elements of the amalgamated subgroup.
--
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive public inputs are the amalgamating identification `e`, the represented element
-- `w : P`, and the reduced word `u : W`. The textbook notion “`u` is a normal form of `w`” is the
-- derived conjunction that `u` is reduced and evaluates to `w`, together with the source
-- restriction `w ≠ 1`. The uniqueness-of-length statement is derived through the canonical owner
-- `syllableLength`, not by a second parallel length API.

/-- Definition 5-11-1: if `w ≠ 1` is an element of the free product of `G` and `H` with `A` and
`B` amalgamated along `e`, then a normal form of `w` is a reduced alternating word in the two
factors whose product is `w`. The length-one exception for letters lying in the amalgamated part
is already built into `Reduced e`. -/

/-- A source normal form has the canonical pushout syllable length, except that a nontrivial
element of the amalgamated subgroup is counted as one syllable in the source convention. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose a transversal for the amalgamated product and compare `u` with the
-- canonical `NormalWord` of `w`. Away from the amalgamated subgroup, `u` and the canonical normal
-- word have the same factor pattern, so they have the same syllable count. If `w` lies in the
-- amalgamated subgroup, the chosen normal word has syllable length `0`, while the source
-- convention records the unique nontrivial base syllable, producing `max 1 0 = 1`.
