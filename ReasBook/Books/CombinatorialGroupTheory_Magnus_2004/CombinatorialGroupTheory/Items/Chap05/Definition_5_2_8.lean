Primary domain: combinatorial degrees attached to vertices and regions of a planar map.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the degree of a vertex, the degree of a region, and for a chosen planar map
  the number `i(D)` of interior edges occurring in a region boundary cycle.
- `core/canonical`: `OneComplex` is the owner of vertices and oriented edges,
  `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` is the owner of unoriented regions, `Cycle.length` and
  `Cycle.toMultiset` are the canonical multiplicity-sensitive boundary owners, and
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsInteriorEdge` from Definition `5-2-7` is the chapter owner for
  interior edges of a planar map.
- `bridge/view`: an oriented face representative presents a geometric face, and a total boundary
  arrow determines the corresponding geometric edge via `TwoComplex.boundaryArrowGeometricEdge`.

Domain sampling:
1. `OneComplex.initial` is the owner map for the initial vertex of an oriented edge.
2. `Cycle.length` and `Cycle.toMultiset` are the canonical ways to read multiplicity-sensitive
   size and order-insensitive multiplicity data from a cyclic boundary.
3. `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` is the owner carrier for textbook regions, so region invariants
   should be defined on geometric faces rather than on oriented face representatives.
4. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsInteriorEdge` from Definition `5-2-7` is the owner predicate
   for interior edges of a planar map, so `i(D)` should count boundary arrows whose geometric
   edge is interior for the chosen planar embedding.
