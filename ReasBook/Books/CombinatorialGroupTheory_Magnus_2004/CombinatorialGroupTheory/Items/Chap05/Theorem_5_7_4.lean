Primary domain: boundary-layer peeling for planar small-cancellation maps.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a `(q, p)` map `M`, the iterated sequence obtained by repeatedly deleting the
  boundary layer, and the resulting bound on the largest boundary complexity `β(Mᵢ)`.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsRoundBracketPQMap` is the owner for `(q, p)`
  maps, `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryLayerEdge` together with the interior predicates
  from Definition `5-2-7` are the owners for deleting a boundary layer, and
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.boundaryRegionAdjustedInteriorEdgeDefectSum`, with source-facing
  notation `σ'(M)[p, q]`, is the existing owner for the starred sum `σ'(M)`. The disc-or-annulus
  component hypothesis is owned by
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.HasSimplyConnectedOrAnnularComponents` from Lemma `5-6-1`.
- `bridge/view`: the source quantity `β(M)` is realized as the number of boundary regions, while
  the successive maps `M₀, ..., M_k` are represented by an inductive boundary-layer deletion
  sequence built from carried subcomplexes and their induced planar embeddings; the relation
  `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsBoundaryLayerComplement` is the thin bridge saying which subcomplex is
  kept at each step.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.boundaryRegionAdjustedInteriorEdgeDefectSum` from
   `Corollary_5_3_5`, with notation `σ'(M)[p, q]`, is the established owner for the source sum
   `σ'(M)`.
2. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsBoundaryLayerComplement` from `Corollary_5_7_3` is the bridge/view
   predicate expressing that a chosen subcomplex is the complement of the boundary layer.
3. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.HasSimplyConnectedOrAnnularComponents` from Lemma `5-6-1` is
   the chapter owner for the disc-or-annulus component hypothesis.
4. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsRoundBracketPQMap` from `Definition_5_3_1` is the owner for
   the source `(q, p)` hypothesis.

-- Proof sketch: first pass to a dual boundary-layer deletion sequence and use Corollary `5-7-3`
-- to keep duality after each peeling step. Lemma `5-7-1` gives monotonicity of the corresponding
-- dual boundary-vertex sum under each deletion, so the initial starred sum `σ'(M)` dominates the
-- starred sums of all later stages. Duality identifies `β(Mᵢ)` with the boundary-vertex count of
-- the dual stage, and the boundary-count estimate from Lemma `5-6-1` then yields the stated
-- factor `q / p`.
/-- Theorem 5-7-4: if `M` is a `(q, p)` map whose connected components are each simply connected
or annular, and `M = M₀, M₁, ..., M_k` is a sequence obtained by repeatedly deleting the boundary
layer until the last map is equal to its own boundary layer, then the maximum of the source
quantities `β(Mᵢ)` is bounded by `(q / p) σ'(M)`, represented here by
`((q : ℚ) / p) * σ'(embedding)[p, q]` for the initial map and by
`maxBoundaryRegionCount` for the boundary-layer deletion sequence. -/
