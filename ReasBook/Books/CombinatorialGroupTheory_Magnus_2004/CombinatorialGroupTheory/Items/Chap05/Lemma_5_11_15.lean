Primary domain: one-relator groups and the Nielsen-transform step that prepares a relator for an
HNN-extension argument.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a one-relator presentation `⟨X ; r⟩` with at least two generators, together
  with the existence of an equivalent one-relator presentation whose relator has exponent sum zero
  in some distinguished generator.
- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton r)` for the one-relator quotient,
  `MulAut (FreeGroup X)` for Nielsen-transform automorphisms of the ambient free group,
  `FreeGroup.lift` for the exponent-sum homomorphism, and `Cardinal.mk X` for the lower bound on
  the size of the generator type.
- `bridge/view`: the new presentation is obtained by applying a free-group automorphism `α` to the
  relator, and `QuotientGroup.congr` together with `Subgroup.map_normalClosure` supplies the
  canonical quotient transport from `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton r)` to
  `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton (α r))`.

Domain sampling:
1. `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton r)` is the project owner for a one-relator group with defining
   relator `r`.
2. `MulAut (FreeGroup X)` is the canonical owner for Nielsen moves on the ambient free group.
3. `QuotientGroup.congr` together with `Subgroup.map_normalClosure` is the canonical transport
   from a free-group automorphism to the induced equivalence of one-relator quotients.
4. `FreeGroup.lift` is the canonical way to define the exponent-sum homomorphism from the free
   group by sending one generator to `1 ∈ ℤ` and all others to `0`.
5. `Cardinal.mk X` is the project's universe-stable expression of “at least two generators”.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive source data are the generator type `X`, the relator `r`, and the cardinality
assumption `2 ≤ Cardinal.mk X`; the Nielsen automorphism `α`, the rewritten relator `α r`, the
distinguished generator `t` are derived existential data, while the induced presentation
equivalence is canonically supplied by `QuotientGroup.congr` and `Subgroup.map_normalClosure`, so
no wrapper structure is introduced.

-- Proof sketch: if some generator already has exponent sum `0` in `r`, keep that generator. If
-- not, choose two distinct generators and perform Nielsen moves on the free basis, replacing one
-- generator by a product with a suitable power of the other. The classical induction on the sum
-- of the absolute values of the two exponent sums decreases under this move, yielding an
-- automorphic relator whose exponent sum in one distinguished generator is `0`; the corresponding
-- one-relator quotient equivalence is the canonical `QuotientGroup.congr` transport.
