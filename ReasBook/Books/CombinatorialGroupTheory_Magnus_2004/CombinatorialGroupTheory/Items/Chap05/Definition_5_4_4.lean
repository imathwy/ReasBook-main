Primary domain: boundary regions in planar map theory.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: for a chosen region `D` of a planar map `M`, the intersection `∂D ∩ ∂M`
  should be realized by a consecutive string of closed edges that appears along both the boundary
  of `D` and some boundary cycle of `M`.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding C 𝔼²` is the owner of the planar map,
  `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` is the owner of an unoriented region, `boundary`, `region`, and
  `geometricEdgeSet` are the source-facing planar subsets, and `IsBoundaryCycle` from
  Definition `5-4-2` is the existing owner predicate for boundary cycles of the whole map.
- `bridge/view`: `Quiver.Path.CyclicPath.HasPart` is the owner predicate for a consecutive segment
  of a cyclic boundary path, and `TwoComplex.boundaryArrowGeometricEdge` maps that total-arrow
  segment to the corresponding geometric-edge string used in the source statement.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryCycle` from Definition `5-4-2` is the existing owner
   for ambient boundary cycles of a surface embedding.
2. `TwoComplex.boundaryArrowGeometricEdge` from Definition `5-1-1` is the canonical bridge from
   an oriented boundary arrow to the underlying closed geometric edge.
3. `Quiver.Path.CyclicPath.HasPart` is the owner-side consecutive-segment predicate on cyclic
   boundary data; it packages the representative-loop plus `List.IsInfix` formulation once.
4. `frontier (embedding.region D)` and `embedding.boundary` are the source-facing subsets for
   `∂D` and `∂M`, while `embedding.geometricEdgeSet e` is the closed edge corresponding to `e`.
