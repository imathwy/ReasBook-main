Primary domain: annular small-cancellation diagrams for conjugacy in relator quotients.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: two cyclically reduced words `u` and `z` in the free group `F` whose images in
  `G = F / N` are conjugate, together with the existence of a reduced annular `R`-diagram whose
  chosen outer and inner boundary components carry the cyclic words of `u` and `z⁻¹`,
  respectively.
- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroup X` is the owner for the ambient free group,
  `PresentedGroup.mk R` is the canonical quotient map into `G = F / N`,
  `GroupDiagram.AnnularRDiagram` from Lemma `5-5-1` is the chapter owner for annular
  `R`-diagrams,
  `GroupDiagram.IsReduced` is the owner predicate for reduced diagrams, and
  `CyclicWord X` is the chapter owner for cyclically reduced boundary words modulo rotation,
  while `GroupDiagram.pathLabelWord` is the source-facing boundary-word API attached to a chosen
  loop.
- `bridge/view`: `Loop` and `cyclicPath` give based representatives of the chosen outer and inner
  boundary cycles. The based boundary labels remain list words, but the public boundary
  conclusion is recorded through the owner `CyclicWord X` rather than only through raw equalities
  in `Cycle (X × Bool)`.

Domain sampling:
1. `GroupDiagram.IsReduced` from Definition `5-2-5` is the existing owner predicate for reduced
   diagrams.
2. `GroupDiagram.AnnularRDiagram` from Lemma `5-5-1` is the chapter owner for annular
   `R`-diagrams.
3. `PresentedGroup.mk R` from the presentation API is the canonical quotient map used throughout
   the chapter for passing from `FreeGroup X` to the relator quotient.
4. `CyclicWord X` from Definition `1-4-17` is the chapter owner for cyclically reduced boundary
   words modulo rotation.
5. `GroupDiagram.pathLabelWord` from Definition `5-1-5` is the owner boundary-word API for a
   chosen loop; the resulting cyclic boundary data should be exposed via `CyclicWord X`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the annular `R`-diagram owner together with nonemptiness of regions and
  reducedness of the underlying labelled map;
- derived API: chosen loop representatives of the outer and inner boundary cycles whose read words
  determine the prescribed cyclic boundary words of `u` and `z⁻¹`, stated directly through
  `pathLabelWord` and the owner `CyclicWord X`.

-- Proof sketch: choose a minimal relator-conjugate expression witnessing that the images of `u`
-- and `z` are conjugate in `PresentedGroup R`, build the corresponding annular van Kampen
-- diagram, and remove the distinguished `z`-region from the minimal disc diagram. Minimality
-- gives reducedness, while the surviving outer and inner boundary loops read cyclically reduced
-- boundary words whose cyclic words are exactly those of `u` and `z⁻¹`, respectively. If there
-- were no regions left, the annulus would already witness that `u` and `z` are conjugate in the
-- free group, contradicting `h_not_conj`.
/-- Lemma 5-5-2: if `u` and `z` are cyclically reduced words of the free group `F = FreeGroup X`,
`u` and `z` are not conjugate in `F` although their images in `G = F / N` are conjugate, then
there exists a reduced annular
`R`-diagram with at least one region together with chosen outer and inner boundary loops whose
boundary labels realize the cyclic words of `u` and `z⁻¹`, respectively. -/
