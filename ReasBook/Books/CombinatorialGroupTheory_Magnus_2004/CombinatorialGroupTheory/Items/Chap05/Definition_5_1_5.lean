-- Primary domain: small-cancellation diagrams over a free group with a chosen basis.
--
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a group-labelled singular disc in the free group whose chosen outer boundary
-- loop reads the prescribed product `c₁ ⋯ cₙ` and whose region boundary words read the listed
-- relators up to conjugacy.
-- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroupBasis X F` is the owner abstraction for a free group with chosen
-- basis, `GroupDiagram F` is the owner abstraction for an oriented map labelled by group
-- elements, `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` is the chapter owner for genuine disc-diagram
-- geometry, and `Loop` together with `cyclicPath` are the owner abstractions for boundary loops
-- and boundary cycles.
-- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.fullSubcomplex` turns the whole labelled map into the ambient
-- subcomplex required by `IsSingularDisc`, `basis.repr` reads an intrinsic element of `F` as a
-- reduced word in the chosen basis, and `GroupDiagram.pathLabelWord` is the source-facing
-- boundary word obtained by concatenating those reduced edge-label words along a path.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `FreeGroupBasis X F` is the established owner for “a free group with a given basis”.
-- 2. `GroupDiagram F` from Definition `5-1-3` is the existing owner for a labelled oriented map.
-- 3. `GroupDiagram.pathLabel` from Definition `5-1-4` is the existing owner for multiplying edge
--    labels along a path.
-- 4. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` from Proposition `3-9-1` is the chapter owner for a
--    planar simply connected disc with explicit boundary cycle and geometric edge incidence.
-- 5. `IsConj` is mathlib's owner relation for “is a conjugate of”, while
--    `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced` is the owner predicate for cyclically reduced reduced words.
--
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the underlying `GroupDiagram`, the chosen outer boundary loop, the
-- singular-disc owner proof for its cyclic boundary, and the relator conditions. The ambient
-- connectedness and simple connectedness of the whole labelled map are derived from the
-- singular-disc owner on the full subcomplex. Finiteness is likewise derived from that owner,
-- while the reduced and cyclically reduced boundary conditions are stated directly on the
-- source-facing boundary word `pathLabelWord`; the bridge back to the intrinsic product
-- `pathLabel` is derived via `basis.repr`.
