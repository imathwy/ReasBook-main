-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: quadratic word sets over a chosen free basis together with their incidence
-- graph.
-- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroupBasis X F` as the owner abstraction for the basis, together with
-- `reducedWordSupport` on the canonical free-group model `FreeGroup X`.
-- `bridge/view`: `basis.repr` is the canonical equivalence used to read an element of `F` as a
-- reduced word over the basis alphabet `X`; the letter-occurrence API below is the thin bridge
-- `x ∈ reducedWordSupport (basis.repr g)`.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `FreeGroupBasis` in mathlib is the owner abstraction for a chosen basis of a free group.
-- 2. `reducedWordSupport` from Proposition `1-5-6` is the chapter owner for basis-support in a
--    canonical reduced word.
-- 3. The `FunLike` instance on `FreeGroupBasis` makes the basis map itself canonical, so the
--    corresponding subset of basis generators is `Set.range basis` rather than a parallel wrapper.
-- 4. `basis.repr` is the canonical transport from the intrinsic basis-level group `F` to
--    `FreeGroup X`.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source-facing data here are the quadraticity predicate and its incidence graph;
-- the basis-generator subset appearing in the conclusion is derived owner API and is therefore
-- stated directly as `Set.range basis`, while the word-level occurrence relation is the thin
-- bridge from `basis.repr` to `reducedWordSupport`.

/-- Proposition 1-7-4: if `S` is quadratic over the basis `X`, connected via its incidence graph,
and infinite, then some automorphism of `F` carries `S` into the chosen basis subset. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose an infinite path in a maximal tree of the incidence graph, orient the tree
-- upward, and apply the preceding quadratic-word-set construction to obtain an automorphism whose
-- inverse sends each word of `S` to a basis generator.
