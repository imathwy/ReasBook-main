/- Proposition 1-3-13: every nontrivial finitely generated normal subgroup of a free group has
finite index.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a nontrivial finitely generated normal subgroup `N : Subgroup F`.
- `core/canonical`: the subgroup owner `Subgroup F` together with the owner predicates
  `Subgroup.FG`, `Subgroup.Normal`, and `Subgroup.FiniteIndex`.
- `bridge/view`: Proposition `1-3-13` is exactly the specialization `H = N` of Proposition
  `1-3-12`, which already expresses the canonical owner theorem for a finitely generated subgroup
  containing a nontrivial normal subgroup.

Domain sampling:
1. `Subgroup.FG` in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Finiteness` is the owner predicate for finite generation
   of a subgroup.
2. `Subgroup.fg_iff` in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Finiteness` shows that finite generation is derived
   from the canonical subgroup owner via closure of a finite set, not from extra packaged data.
3. `Subgroup.FiniteIndex` in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Index` is the owner predicate for finite index,
   and `finiteIndex_iff_finite_quotient` is its standard quotient-level bridge.
4. `finiteIndex_of_fg_of_contains_nontrivial_normal` in Proposition `1-3-12` is the chapter owner
   theorem whose diagonal specialization `H = N` is exactly this proposition.

Best owner abstraction:
the public mathematics already lives at the canonical subgroup-owner level of Proposition
`1-3-12`; this proposition adds no new owner data beyond the diagonal specialization `H = N`.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive mathematical data are just the subgroup `N` and the owner predicates `N.FG`,
`N.Normal`, and `N ≠ ⊥`; the finite-index conclusion is derived. Since Proposition `1-3-12`
already consumes exactly those owner-level inputs after the canonical inclusion `N ≤ N = le_rfl`,
keeping a separate local theorem would duplicate the API surface without adding mathematics.

Accordingly, this file keeps only the exact diagonal recall term rather than a parallel local
specialization theorem. -/
