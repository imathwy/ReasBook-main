-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: finite connected quadratic word sets over a chosen free basis that are not
-- strictly quadratic.
-- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroupBasis X F`, `IsQuadraticWordSet`, `wordIncidenceGraph`, and
-- `MulAut F`.
-- `bridge/view`: `basisWordLetters`, `basisLetterOccurs`, and `generatorFiber` from
-- Proposition `1-7-4` are the owner-derived reduced-word occurrence API; the strictness predicate
-- below records that each basis generator occurs in either zero or two words of the set, matching
-- the textbook distinction between quadratic and strictly quadratic families.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `FreeGroupBasis X F` is the owner abstraction for the chosen basis of the ambient free group.
-- 2. `IsQuadraticWordSet` and `wordIncidenceGraph` from Proposition `1-7-4` are the source-facing
--    owner declarations for quadratic families and their connectivity graph in this section.
-- 3. `generatorFiber basis S x` is the canonical derived owner view of the words of `S`
--    containing a given basis letter.
-- 4. The chosen basis subset of `F` is the canonical owner expression `Set.range basis`.

/-- A quadratic word set is strictly quadratic when every basis generator occurs in either zero or
two words of the set. -/
def IsStrictlyQuadraticWordSet (basis : FreeGroupBasis X F) (S : Set F) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : X, (generatorFiber basis S x).encard = 0 ∨ (generatorFiber basis S x).encard = 2

/-- A quadratic but not strictly quadratic word set has some basis generator that occurs in
exactly one word. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose a generator for which the strict `0-or-2` alternative fails. The quadratic
-- hypothesis bounds its incidence fiber by `2`, so the only remaining cardinal possibility is
-- `1`.

/-- Proposition 1-7-5: if `S` is quadratic over the chosen basis, not strictly quadratic, finite,
and connected, then some automorphism of `F` sends `S` into the chosen basis subset. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose a basis generator `x₀` occurring in exactly one word of `S`, orient the
-- finite incidence tree toward that distinguished word, and use the descending-chain argument from
-- Proposition `1-7-3` to build an automorphism whose image of `S` lies in the basis subset.
