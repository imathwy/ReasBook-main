/- Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the two-step Section `11` reduction step with syllables `u₀`, `u₁`, bridge
  data `a`, decompositions `uᵢ = pᵢ⁻¹ * hᵢ * qᵢ`, and the source comparison `A p₀ < A q₀`.
- `core/canonical`: the amalgamated-product owner `Monoid.PushoutI φ`, the chosen normal-form
  data `NormalWord.Transversal φ`, the chapter length `syllableLength d`, and the Section `11`
  owner predicates `IsSection11BridgeStep` and `IsSection11ReductionChain`.
- `bridge/view`: the specialization `n = 1` of the general reduction-chain API from
  Lemma `1-11-3`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.PushoutI` is the chapter/mathlib owner abstraction for the amalgamated product.
2. `Monoid.PushoutI.syllableLength` from Definition `1-11-2` is the chapter owner for the Section
   `11` length notation.
3. `Monoid.PushoutI.IsSection11BridgeStep` from Lemma `1-11-3` is the canonical owner predicate
   for the bridge between adjacent Section `11` syllables.
4. `Monoid.PushoutI.IsSection11ReductionChain` from Lemma `1-11-3` is the canonical owner
   predicate for the full finite reduction chain, and its forward-comparison clause already
   packages the strict inequality proved in this two-step case.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data here are the chain entries `u`, `a`, `p`, `h`, `q`, together with the
source comparison relation `A_lt` and the canonical reduction-chain predicate relating them. The
strict inequality for the right syllable is derived from that owner predicate and should not be
repackaged through a chosen bridge list or an auxiliary preorder-valued key. -/

/-- Lemma 1-11-19: in the two-step Section `11` reduction-chain situation, if the left
decomposition satisfies `A p < A q`, then the right syllable is strictly shorter than the middle
product `u₀ * a₀ * u₁`. -/
