-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the word problem in the Section `8` ambient free product `F ∗ R`, tested via
-- the canonical induced coproduct maps attached to split retractions of `R`.
-- `core/canonical`: Proposition `1-8-1` is the owner implication from the universal induced test
-- to `w = 1` under the canonical point-separation hypothesis on those maps,
-- `inducedSplitRetraction` is the induced coproduct map, `inducedRetractionMaps` is the
-- associated family of functions, and `DecidablePred` is Lean's canonical interface for
-- decidability of the word problem.
-- `bridge/view`: the universal induced-retraction test is the contraposed form of Proposition
-- `1-8-1`, derived internally here rather than exposed as a second public owner theorem.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. Proposition `1-8-1` supplies the owner implication from the universal test to `w = 1`.
-- 2. `SplitToInfiniteCyclic R` is the chapter owner vocabulary for the split retractions tested in
--    Section `8`.
-- 3. `Set.SeparatesPoints` is mathlib's owner abstraction for the missing separation hypothesis on
--    a family of functions.
-- 4. `DecidablePred` is the canonical owner API for a solvable yes/no problem on a fixed type.

/-- Proposition 1-8-2: in the Section `8` ambient free product `F ∗ R`, the word problem is
decidable once one can decide whether a word maps to `1` under every induced homomorphism coming
from a split retraction of `R` onto the infinite cyclic group, provided those induced maps
separate points of `F ∗ R`. -/
-- Proof sketch: Proposition `1-8-1` turns the universal induced-retraction vanishing test into a
-- sufficient criterion for `w = 1` once the induced maps separate points. The given decision
-- procedure transports across that implication.
