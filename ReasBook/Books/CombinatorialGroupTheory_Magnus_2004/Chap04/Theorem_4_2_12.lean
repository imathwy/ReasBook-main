Primary domain: conjugacy in free products with amalgamation.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: cyclically reduced reduced words in the two-factor amalgamated product
  `⟨G * H; A = B, e⟩`, together with the statement that cyclically reduced
  conjugates of length at least `2` differ by cyclic permutation and conjugation from the
  amalgamated subgroup.
- `core/canonical`: `Monoid.CoprodI.Word` for reduced alternating words,
  `Monoid.PushoutI` for the amalgamated product, `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong e` for the
  chapter-facing two-factor owner with named `left`, `right`, `base`, and `ofWord`,
  `Monoid.PushoutI.Reduced` for owner-side reducedness, `List.IsRotated` for cyclic permutation,
  and `IsConj` for conjugacy in the ambient group.
- `bridge/view`: `Monoid.PushoutI.TwoFactorReduced` is the generic `Bool`/`ULift` bridge, while
  `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.Reduced` is the subgroup-specialized source-facing
  reduced-word predicate from Definition `4-2-9`. The map
  `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.ofWord e` is the derived conversion from that presentation to
  the owner object. Chosen transversals and `NormalWord` realizations remain proof-internal via
  `Monoid.PushoutI.Reduced.exists_normalWord_prod_eq`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.CoprodI.Word` is the chapter's intrinsic owner for source reduced words in free-product
   style normal forms.
2. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.Reduced` is the upstream source-facing reducedness predicate
   for two-factor amalgamated products over identified subgroups.
3. Proposition `3-12-5` already fixes the chapter owner pattern for two-factor amalgamated
   products: a named `Subgroup` owner with named embeddings rather than a raw `Bool`-indexed
   pushout surface.
4. `List.IsRotated` is the canonical owner for cyclic permutation of syllable lists.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data are the two factors `G`, `H`, the amalgamating subgroups `A` and `B`,
the identification `e : A ≃* B`, and the source reduced words `u` and `v`. Reducedness and
cyclic reducedness are expressed directly on those words. The owner
`Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong e`, its canonical embeddings, and word evaluation are derived
operations.

/-- Theorem 4-2-12: in the free product with amalgamation of `G` and `H`
over `A = B` via `e`, if a reduced word `u` is cyclically reduced and has at least two syllables,
then every cyclically reduced conjugate reduced word `v` is obtained by cyclically permuting the
syllables of `u` and then conjugating by an element of the amalgamated subgroup `A`. -/
-- Proof sketch: pass from the source reduced words to chosen normal forms only internally, using
-- the canonical existence theorem `Reduced.exists_normalWord_prod_eq`. The conjugacy theorem for
-- amalgamated products applied to those normal forms shows that a cyclically reduced conjugate of
-- a cyclically reduced word of length at least two can only arise from rotating the syllable list
-- and then conjugating by an element of the amalgamated subgroup. Translating back to the source
-- reduced-word layer yields the stated conclusion.
