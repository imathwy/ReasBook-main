Primary domain: free products of groups and their canonical factor subgroups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the free product `A ∗ B`, its two canonical factor subgroups, and the textbook
  claims that the free product depends only on the factor groups and contains isomorphic copies of
  the factors generating the whole group with trivial intersection.
- `core/canonical`: `Monoid.Coprod` with notation `A ∗ B` is mathlib's owner for the free
  product, `MulEquiv.coprodCongr` is the canonical invariance theorem under factor isomorphisms,
  and the canonical injections `inl`, `inr` together with `MonoidHom.ofInjective` and
  `range_inl_sup_range_inr` give the range-level factor API.
- `bridge/view`: the subgroup-valued view of the two factors inside `A ∗ B` is obtained by passing
  from the canonical injections to their ranges.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.Coprod` is the canonical free-product owner abstraction in mathlib.
2. `MulEquiv.coprodCongr` is the canonical statement that free products are preserved by
   equivalences of factors.
3. `MonoidHom.ofInjective` is the canonical equivalence from a group to the range of an
   injective homomorphism; the canonical projections prove injectivity here.
4. `Monoid.Coprod.range_inl_sup_range_inr` is the canonical generation statement for the two
   factor ranges inside a free product.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the factor groups `A`, `B`, the free product `A ∗ B`, and the canonical
  injections of the two factors;
- derived API: the factor ranges `(inl : A →* A ∗ B).range` and `(inr : B →* A ∗ B)`, the induced
  equivalences from `A` and `B` onto those ranges via the canonical projections `fst` and `snd`,
  and the facts that these subgroups generate the free product and intersect trivially.
