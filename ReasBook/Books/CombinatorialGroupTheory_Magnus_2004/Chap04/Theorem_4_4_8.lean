Primary domain: algorithmic group theory for finitely presented residually finite groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an abstract group `G` together with the textbook assertion that finite
  presentability and residual finiteness imply solvability of the word problem for `G`.
- `core/canonical`: `Group.IsFinitelyPresented G` and `Group.ResiduallyFinite G` are mathlib's
  owner predicates for the two hypotheses, while `PresentedGroup R ≃* G` is the project's
  canonical bridge from a finite-generator presentation to an abstract group.
- `bridge/view`: the chapter's concrete owner predicate for solvability is
  `GroupPresentation.HasSolvableWordProblem R` on a relator set `R`, so the abstract group-level
  property is recorded by the existence of some finite-generator presentation with that property.

Domain sampling:
1. `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` is mathlib's canonical abstract owner for finite presentability.
2. `Group.ResiduallyFinite` is mathlib's canonical abstract owner for residual finiteness.
3. `PresentedGroup R ≃* G` is the project's canonical presentation datum from Definition `2-1-1`.
4. `GroupPresentation.HasSolvableWordProblem R` is the chapter owner predicate for solvability of
   the word problem in a concrete presentation.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data for the abstract owner: only the ambient group `G`;
- derived bridge data: a finite generator rank `n`, a relator set
  `R : Set (FreeGroup (Fin n))`, and a presentation equivalence `PresentedGroup R ≃* G`.

-- Proof sketch: choose a finite presentation of `G` from `IsFinitelyPresented G`. For that
-- presentation, words equal to `1` are recursively enumerable from the finite relator set, while
-- residual finiteness lets one recursively enumerate the words not equal to `1` by searching over
-- all homomorphisms from `G` to finite groups and checking when the image of the word is
-- nontrivial. Running the two enumerations in parallel yields a decision procedure for the word
-- problem of the chosen finite presentation, which then witnesses `HasSolvableWordProblem G`.
