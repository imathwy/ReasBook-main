Primary domain: cyclic reduction for normal-form words in a free product with amalgamation.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a reduced two-factor word `w = y₁ ⋯ yₙ` in amalgam normal form, together with
  the textbook predicate “weakly cyclically reduced”, and the specialization of the already owned
  cyclic-reduction predicate to normal-form words.
- `core/canonical`: `Monoid.CoprodI.Word` is the owner for reduced alternating words in the two
  factors, specialized here through `Monoid.CoprodI.twoFactorFamily G H`.
- `bridge/view`: the first and last letters of a nonempty word are boundary data in one of the two
  factors, viewed in the ambient amalgamated product through `Monoid.PushoutI.of`; weak cyclic
  reduction compares their product with the canonical base subgroup `(base e).range`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.CoprodI.Word.IsCyclicallyReduced` from Theorem `4-2-12` is the chapter owner for
   cyclic reduction of a reduced alternating two-factor word.
2. `Monoid.CoprodI.NeWord.head` and `Monoid.CoprodI.NeWord.last` show that first and last letters
   are canonical boundary data of a nonempty reduced word.
3. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.Reduced` is the chapter-facing owner for “normal form” in the
   two-factor amalgamated product.
4. `Monoid.PushoutI.of` and `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.base` are the canonical factor and
   base embeddings into the ambient amalgamated product.

Primitive vs. derived:
primitive public data: a source word `w : Word Family`, together with the owner-side reducedness
proof `Reduced e w` from Definition `4-2-9`, and its first and last boundary letters;
- derived API: the recalled cyclic-reduction owner predicate and the source weak cyclic-reduction
  predicate.

/-- Definition 5-11-2 (2): a normal-form word is weakly cyclically reduced when a boundary pinch
through the amalgamated subgroup can occur only in syllable length at most one. Equivalently, for
words of length greater than one, if the last and first syllables lie in the same factor, then
their product does not lie in the amalgamated subgroup. -/
