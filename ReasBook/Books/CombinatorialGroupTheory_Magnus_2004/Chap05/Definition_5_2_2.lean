Primary domain: small-cancellation conditions for a relator set in a free group with a chosen
basis.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a basis `basis : FreeGroupBasis X F`, a relator set `R : Set F`, the
  symmetrized relator family `R*`, and decompositions of one symmetrized relator into piece-words.
- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroupBasis X F` is the owner abstraction for expressing elements of `F`
  on the chosen basis, and `GroupPresentation.symmetrizedRelatorFamily` is the owner for the
  symmetrized relator family.
- `bridge/view`: `basis.repr '' R` transports the source relators to `FreeGroup X`, while the
  underlying cycle `q.1` of a `CyclicWord X` compares one symmetrized relator with the flattened
  concatenation of piece-words.

Domain sampling:
1. `FreeGroupBasis X F` is the chapter's owner abstraction for a chosen free basis.
2. `GroupPresentation.symmetrizedRelatorFamily` from Proposition `3-11-2` is the chapter owner
   for the symmetrized relator family `R*`.
3. `FreeGroupBasis.is_piece` from Definition `5-2-1` is the chapter owner for a piece word.
4. `CyclicWord X` is the owner abstraction for a symmetrized relator modulo cyclic permutation,
   and `List.flatten` is the natural concatenation owner for a finite list of piece-words.
