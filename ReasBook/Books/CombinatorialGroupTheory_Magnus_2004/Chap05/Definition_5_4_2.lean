Primary domain: extremal disc submaps in planar map theory.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a submap `K` of a map `M` that is topologically a disk and whose boundary
  edges occur in order along some boundary cycle of `M`.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` is the project owner for submaps,
  `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` is the existing owner predicate for disc-like submaps
  together with a chosen boundary cycle, and `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryEdge` is the
  owner predicate for ambient boundary edges of a planar map.
- `bridge/view`: `Loop`, `cyclicPath`, `edgeList`, and `OneComplex.Hom.mapLoop` applied to the
  inclusion `K.skeleton.inclusion` compare a boundary cycle in the submap with a boundary cycle
  in the ambient map through ordered total-edge lists.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex` from Proposition `3-3-5` is the chapter owner for submaps.
2. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` from Proposition `3-9-1` is the owner predicate for a
   submap that is topologically a disk together with an explicit boundary cycle.
3. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryEdge` from Definition `5-2-7` is the owner predicate
   for edges lying on the boundary of the ambient planar map.
4. `Loop`, `cyclicPath`, and `edgeList` from Definition `3-2-3` are the canonical ordered
   boundary-cycle API, and `OneComplex.Hom.mapLoop` applied to `K.skeleton.inclusion` is the
   bridge from a submap boundary loop to the corresponding ambient boundary loop.
