Primary domain: annular van Kampen diagrams in the plane.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an annular `R`-diagram with chosen outer and inner boundary cycles whose
  labels represent conjugate elements in the presented group.
- `core/canonical`: `GroupDiagram (FreeGroup X)` is the owner of the labelled diagram,
  `GroupDiagram.IsRDiagram` is the owner of the relator condition,
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding` with `IsPlanarMap` is the owner of the planar realization, and
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryCycle` is the owner of an individual ambient boundary
  cycle, while `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.HasSimpleBoundary`, used in Lemma `5-4-3` on
  `C.fullSubcomplex`, is the established whole-boundary simple-cycle owner.
- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.boundaryCycleSupport` is the owner-side planar
  support of a chosen boundary cycle, and
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.HasAnnularBoundaryCycles` is the owner-side annular boundary
  decomposition asserting that the actual ambient boundary subset is the union of two disjoint
  simple closed curves carried by the chosen outer and inner boundary cycles.
  `GroupDiagram.AnnularRDiagram` then packages exactly the source-facing annular `R`-diagram
  data built from that geometry and the `R`-diagram hypothesis. `Loop` and `cyclicPath` provide
  the based representatives needed to read boundary labels.

Domain sampling:
1. `GroupDiagram.IsRDiagram` from Definition `5-1-8` is the chapter owner for the `R`-diagram
   hypothesis.
2. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryCycle` from Definition `5-4-2` is the owner predicate
   for a chosen boundary cycle.
3. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.HasSimpleBoundary` from Proposition `3-7-5` is the established owner
   shape for saying that a subcomplex boundary is a simple cycle, with Lemma `5-4-3` using it for
   the whole map via `C.fullSubcomplex`.
4. `GroupDiagram.pathLabel` from Definition `5-1-4` is the owner map for reading the label of a
   based boundary loop.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the owner-side planar support `embedding.boundaryCycleSupport c` of a
  chosen boundary cycle, the generic annular boundary decomposition
  `embedding.HasAnnularBoundaryCycles σ τ` asserting that the actual map boundary is the union of
  two disjoint simple closed curves supported by `σ` and `τ`, and the source-facing owner
  `GroupDiagram.AnnularRDiagram R` consisting of a labelled diagram, a planar embedding, chosen
  outer and inner boundary cycles, and the `R`-diagram hypothesis;
- derived API: the conjugacy conclusion in `PresentedGroup R`.

-- Proof sketch: choose a path in the connected annular diagram from a vertex on the outer
-- boundary cycle to a vertex on the inner boundary cycle. Cutting the annulus open along that
-- path produces a singular disc whose boundary label is
-- `M.pathLabel outer.2 * b * (M.pathLabel inner.2) * b⁻¹`. The van Kampen relation for an
-- `R`-diagram makes this boundary word trivial in `PresentedGroup R`, so the image of the outer
-- boundary label is conjugate to the inverse of the inner boundary label there.
/-- In an annular `R`-diagram, the image of the label of a chosen outer boundary loop is conjugate
to the inverse of the label of a chosen inner boundary loop in the presented group
