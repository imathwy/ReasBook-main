Primary domain: combinatorial group theory for staggered presentations and interval restrictions on
normal closures.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a staggered presentation on generators `X` with a distinguished ordered subset
  `X₀`, together with the least and greatest generators of `X₀` occurring in a word.
- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroup X`, `FreeGroupBasis.ofFreeGroup X`, `basisLetterOccurs`, `IsLeast`,
  `IsGreatest`, `Set.Icc`, and `Subgroup.normalClosure`.
- `bridge/view`: distinguished support is the subset of `X₀` cut out by the owner predicate
  `basisLetterOccurs (FreeGroupBasis.ofFreeGroup X)`, and interval support is expressed as
  inclusion in the canonical interval `Set.Icc xₐ x_b`.

Domain sampling:
1. `FreeGroup X` is the owner object for words in the presentation.
2. `FreeGroupBasis.ofFreeGroup X` together with `basisLetterOccurs` from Proposition `1-7-4` is
   the chapter owner abstraction for the source phrase “the generator `x` occurs in `w`”.
3. `IsLeast`, `IsGreatest`, and `Set.Icc` are the canonical order-theoretic owners for extremal
   distinguished generators and the interval they determine.
4. Proposition `2-5-2` shows the same chapter-level interval/normal-closure pattern for indexed
   generators; this file keeps the extra distinguished-subset data source-facing, but it should
   still reuse the same owner-level occurrence and interval abstractions.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the ordered distinguished subset `X₀` and the indexed relator family
  `r`;
- derived API: the distinguished support set, distinguished interval support, the staggered
  predicate, and the interval-restricted relator set.

-- Proof sketch: choose a van Kampen diagram for `w` over the relators `r`. The staggered ordering
-- forces the least and greatest distinguished generators on the boundary word to control the
-- distinguished supports of every relator that appears in the diagram. Removing extremal faces
-- inductively leaves a diagram using only relators whose distinguished generators lie between
-- those two extremes, so `w` already lies in the normal closure of the interval-restricted
-- relators.
/-- Proposition 3-9-5: if `r` is a staggered presentation relative to `X₀` and a nontrivial word
`w` lies in the normal closure of `r`, then `w` contains generators of `X₀`; choosing the least
and greatest such generators `xₐ` and `x_b`, the word already lies in the normal closure of the
relators whose distinguished generators from `X₀` all lie between `xₐ` and `x_b`. -/
