Primary domain: the standard Cayley complex attached to a presentation.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an actual `TwoComplex` equipped with the standard Cayley coordinates over the
  presented group `PresentedGroup R`, together with the claim that this Cayley complex is simply
  connected.
- `core/canonical`: `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` is the chapter owner for the Cayley-complex
  realization data, `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected` is the owner for simple connectedness of a
  `2`-complex, and `TwoComplex.fundamentalGroup`, written `π(C, v)`, is the owner for the based
  fundamental group.
- `bridge/view`: the pointwise statement `g = 1` is the derived companion of the owner-level
  simply-connectedness statement.

Primitive data vs. derived API:
- primitive data: the actual `TwoComplex` and its Cayley-coordinate realization over
  `PresentedGroup R`;
- derived API: the simple connectedness property and the triviality of each based fundamental
  group.

Domain sampling:
1. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` from Proposition `3-4-1` is the chapter owner for realizing an
   actual `TwoComplex` as a Cayley complex with specified coordinates and left translations.
2. `TwoComplex.fundamentalGroup`, written `π(C, v)`, from Definition `3-2-8` is the owner for
   the based fundamental group.
3. `Subsingleton` is the canonical fiberwise consequence of simple connectedness at a basepoint.

-- Proof sketch: the standard Cayley-complex argument contracts every loop to the empty loop by
-- reducing its label in the free group to the normal closure of the relators and then filling the
-- resulting null-homotopy with the attached `2`-cells.
