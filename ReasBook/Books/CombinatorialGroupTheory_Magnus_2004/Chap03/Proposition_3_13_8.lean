Primary domain: Bass-Serre decompositions of matrix groups over polynomial rings.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the two concrete subgroups of `GL(2, F[t])`, namely the constant-coefficient
  copy of `GL(2, F)` and the upper triangular subgroup `T(F[t])`, with common subgroup `T(F)`.
- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.amalgamatedProduct` and
  `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductComparison` from Proposition `3-12-5`, built on top of mathlib's
  `Monoid.PushoutI`, together with `Matrix.BlockTriangular` for the upper triangular subgroup.
- `bridge/view`: the constant-coefficient embeddings into `GL(2, F[t])` and the coordinate-level
  characterization `g 1 0 = 0` of membership in the upper triangular subgroup.

Domain sampling:
1. Proposition `3-12-5` already exposes `Subgroup.amalgamatedProduct` and
   `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductComparison` as the chapter owner/bridge API for a two-factor
   amalgamated product over a subgroup intersection.
2. `Matrix.BlockTriangular`, `Matrix.blockTriangular_one`, `Matrix.BlockTriangular.mul`, and
   `Matrix.blockTriangular_inv_of_blockTriangular` are the canonical owner lemmas for upper
   triangularity of matrices.
3. `GL (Fin 2) R` is the canonical owner for invertible `2 × 2` matrices over `R`.
4. `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.map` is the canonical way to embed `GL(2, F)` into
   `GL(2, F[t])` along the coefficient homomorphism `Polynomial.C`.
5. `Subgroup.map`, `Subgroup.range`, and `Subgroup.inf` are the canonical subgroup-level APIs for
   the constant copy of `GL(2, F)`, the copy of `T(F)`, and the identified intersection.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the two actual subgroups inside `GL(2, F[t])`, with the upper triangular one
  defined by the intrinsic `Matrix.BlockTriangular` predicate;
- derived data: the coordinate lemma `g 1 0 = 0` for that subgroup, the constant-coefficient
  image of `T(F)` inside `GL(2, F[t])`, the two-factor amalgamated product, and its canonical
  comparison map into the ambient matrix group.

/-- Proposition 3-13-8: the canonical comparison map from the amalgamated free product of the
constant copy of `GL(2, F)` and the upper triangular subgroup `T(F[t])`, with the corresponding
subgroup `T(F)` identified, onto `GL(2, F[t])` is bijective. -/
-- Proof sketch: let `GL(2, F[t])` act on the Behr tree attached to the valuation at infinity on
-- `F(t)`. The quotient graph is an edge; its two vertex stabilizers are the constant copy of
-- `GL(2, F)` and `T(F[t])`, and the edge stabilizer is `T(F)`. Bass-Serre theory then identifies
-- the ambient group with the amalgamated free product of those two stabilizers; the bridge theorem
-- `map_upperTriangularSubgroup_eq_inf` identifies the constant image of the source-facing subgroup
-- `T(F)` with the intersection used by `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductComparison`.
