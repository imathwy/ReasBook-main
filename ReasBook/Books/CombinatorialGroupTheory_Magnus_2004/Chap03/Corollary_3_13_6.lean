Primary domain: short-word specializations of Behr correction words.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the canonical action of `G` on `V`, a positive generator word `g : List X` of
  length at most `3`, the endpoints `v` and `u`, and the same bounded-step / bounded-stabilizer /
  bounded-descent hypotheses as in Lemma `3-13-5`.
- `core/canonical`: `exists_correction_word_with_bounded_prefix_distance` from Lemma `3-13-5` is
  the chapter owner theorem for the correction-word construction.
- `bridge/view`: this corollary is the thin short-word specialization replacing the general tail
  threshold `g.length * k` by the uniform bound `3 * k`.

Domain sampling:
1. `[MulAction G V]` is the owner action abstraction inherited from Lemma `3-13-5`.
2. `List.map` together with `List.prod` is the canonical concrete evaluation API for a positive
   `List X` word in the ambient group.
3. `S[d](o, l)` from Proposition `3-13-1` is the chapter owner notation for the source ball
   condition used in `hdesc`.
4. `exists_correction_word_with_bounded_prefix_distance` is the owner theorem specialized here.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the action, generators, distinguished subset, step bound, basepoint,
  distance, short positive word `g`, vertices `v` and `u`, and the endpoint hypothesis `hu`;
- derived API: the corollary's uniform `3 * k` bound on the distinguished tail of the correction
  word.
