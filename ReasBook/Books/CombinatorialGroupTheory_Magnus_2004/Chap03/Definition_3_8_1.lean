Primary domain: NEC groups, Fuchsian complexes, and regular actions on geometric faces.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a group `G` together with a planar simply connected connected Fuchsian complex
  on which `G` acts regularly on geometric faces.
- `core/canonical`: `FuchsianComplex` is the chapter owner for the actual `2`-complex together
  with the action by automorphisms, while
  `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected (Quiver.Symmetrify _)`, `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected`,
  `TwoComplex.EmbedsInPlane`, and `TwoComplex.AutAction.geometricFaceMulAction` are the owner
  predicates and constructions for the geometric hypotheses and the induced action on geometric
  faces; `MulAction.IsPretransitive` and `IsCancelSMul` are the standard owners for transitivity
  and freeness of that action.
- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.AutAction.IsRegularOnGeometricFaces` below packages the textbook
  phrase “regular on geometric faces” in terms of those canonical group-action owners.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.AutAction` from Proposition `3-7-1` is the chapter owner for an action of `G` on
   a `2`-complex by automorphisms.
2. `FuchsianComplex` from Proposition `3-7-1` is the owner for the underlying complex together
   with that action.
3. `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected (Quiver.Symmetrify _)`, `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected`, and
   `TwoComplex.EmbedsInPlane` are the direct owner predicates for the connected, simply connected,
   and planar hypotheses used in Proposition `3-7-3`.
4. `MulAction.IsPretransitive`, `IsCancelSMul`, and
   `isCancelSMul_iff_stabilizer_eq_bot` are the canonical owner notions for a transitive free
   action and its stabilizer reformulation.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the actual Fuchsian complex;
- derived API: the induced geometric-face action and the regularity property of that action.
