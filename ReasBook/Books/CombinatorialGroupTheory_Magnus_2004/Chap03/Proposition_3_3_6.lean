-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a subgroup `H` of the indexed free product `CoprodI G`, together with a
-- decomposition of `H` as a free product of one free group and subgroup factors of `H` whose
-- ambient images are conjugates of subgroups of the ambient free factors.
-- `core/canonical`: `CoprodI` is mathlib's owner for indexed free products, `IsFreeGroup` is the
-- owner predicate for freeness, and subgroup conjugation is expressed using `MulAut.conj`
-- together with `Subgroup.map`.
-- `bridge/view`: the Chapter 1 owner `IsKuroshFactorDecomposition` packages the distinguished
-- free subgroup together with the subgroup factors into a `CoprodI` decomposition; the extra
-- source-facing content here is only the ambient conjugacy description of the factors.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `CoprodI` and `CoprodI.of` are the canonical indexed free-product owners.
-- 2. `IsFreeGroup` is the canonical owner for the free group factor in the decomposition.
-- 3. `IsKuroshFactorDecomposition` from Proposition `1-11-24` is the project owner for the
--    underlying free-product decomposition data.
-- 4. `Subgroup.map`, `Subgroup.subtype`, and `MulAut.conj` are the standard subgroup and
--    conjugation APIs needed to express the Kurosh factors.

-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source-facing data are the subgroup `H`, the distinguished free subgroup factor
-- `F ≤ H`, the subgroup-factor family `K : J → Subgroup H`, and the free-product equivalence
-- `CoprodI (kuroshFactorFamily F K) ≃* H`; the ambient conjugacy description of each `K j` is the
-- extra source-facing property asserted in this proposition.

/-- Proposition 3-3-6: every subgroup of an indexed free product is itself a free product of one
free group together with subgroup factors lying in the subgroup and equal in the ambient free
product to conjugates of subgroups of the original free factors. -/
-- Proof sketch: realize the ambient free product as the fundamental group of a complex obtained by
-- wedging complexes for the factors, then apply the covering-space description of subgroups from
-- Proposition 3-3-4. Decompose the lifted complex using Proposition 3-3-5; the components lying
-- above the original factor complexes contribute the conjugate subgroup factors, and the remaining
-- tree-complement contributes the free factor.
