Primary domain: spherical diagrams over Cayley complexes and the asphericity of a presentation.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a spherical diagram over the actual Cayley complex `C(X; R)`, its reducedness,
  reduction, triviality, and the resulting asphericity notion for the presentation.
- `core/canonical`: `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` is the owner for the actual Cayley complex of
  `(X; R)`, `TwoComplex.IsSphericalDiagram` is the owner predicate for a combinatorial sphere,
  `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` is the owner predicate for singular subdiscs,
  `TwoComplex.Hom` and `OneComplex.Hom.mapLoop` are the owner maps for sending a carried loop in
  a subdisc into the ambient Cayley complex, and
  `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.boundaryLabel` is the owner for boundary labels in the actual
  Cayley complex.
- `bridge/view`: the source phrase “a spherical diagram is a pair `(S, f)`” is packaged by the
  structure `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.SphericalDiagram`, while the reduction operation is
  expressed by a direct one-step relation carrying the chosen reducible subdisc, its deleted-face
  complement, and explicit sewing comparison data into the target spherical diagram; then
  `Relation.ReflTransGen` is the canonical owner for finite reduction sequences.

Domain sampling:
1. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` from Proposition `3-4-1` is the chapter owner for a chosen actual
   Cayley complex attached to `(X; R)`, so the source-facing API should land directly in `C`.
2. `TwoComplex.IsSphericalDiagram` from Proposition `3-9-7` already packages the connected,
   simply connected, sphere-embedding part of “combinatorial sphere”.
3. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` from Proposition `3-9-1` is the owner for a singular
   subdisc with explicit boundary loop data.
4. `OneComplex.Hom.mapLoop` applied to the inclusion `S.skeleton.inclusion`,
   `TwoComplex.Hom.mapLoop`, and
   `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.boundaryLabel` are the chapter owners for comparing a carried
   subdisc boundary loop with its image in the actual Cayley complex and reading the resulting
   signed boundary word there.
5. `Relation.ReflTransGen` is the canonical closure operator for “obtainable by finitely many
   reductions”, so triviality should be expressed with that owner rather than a bespoke
   transitive closure.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the source `2`-complex, the map into the actual Cayley complex, finiteness of
  the source cells, and for a reduction step the chosen two-face singular subdisc, the complement
  of the deleted faces, and the explicit sewing comparison into the target;
- derived API: reducedness, triviality via repeated reductions, and asphericity of the
  presentation.
