Primary domain: staggered presentations, interval support, and Peiffer reductions of identities
among positive relator conjugates.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a finite formal product of conjugates `u * r * u⁻¹` of relators in a staggered
  presentation, together with the proposition that if the total product only involves special
  generators from an interval `[xₐ, x_b]`, then Peiffer transformations can rewrite the formal
  product so that every relator term itself lies in that interval.
- `core/canonical`: `GroupPresentation.IsStaggeredPresentation` and
  `GroupPresentation.SupportedOnDistinguishedInterval` from Proposition `3-9-5`, the free-group
  list owner `List (FreeGroup X)`, `IsConj` as the owner for conjugacy in the free group, and
  `GroupPresentation.PeifferStep` with its reflexive transitive closure from Proposition `3-10-4`.
- `bridge/view`: the proof-support normal-closure consequence is phrased through the canonical
  owner set `relatorsSupportedOnDistinguishedInterval`, but the main proposition remains
  source-facing over the indexed relator family `r`.

Domain sampling:
1. `GroupPresentation.IsStaggeredPresentation` is already the chapter owner for the source phrase
   “`(X; R)` is a staggered presentation, as in (9.5)”.
2. `GroupPresentation.SupportedOnDistinguishedInterval` is the owner for the statement that only
   distinguished generators in `[xₐ, x_b]` occur in a word or relator.
3. `IsConj` is mathlib's canonical owner for “is a conjugate of”, so the source-facing statement
   should quantify only the relator index `j` and assert `IsConj p (r j)` rather than introduce a
   bespoke witness package.
4. `GroupPresentation.PeifferStep` and `Relation.ReflTransGen` are the canonical owners for
   “carried into by Peiffer transformations”.
5. `Subgroup.normalClosure` remains the owner for the ambient relator subgroup consequence that the
   transformed product still lies in the interval-supported normal closure.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the indexed relator family `r`, the list `π` of positive relator conjugates, and
  the interval `[xₐ, x_b]`;
- derived API: the termwise list conditions expressed through the list owner `List.Forall`, the
  Peiffer-chain product invariance, and the normal-closure consequence phrased via
  `relatorsSupportedOnDistinguishedInterval X₀ r xₐ x_b`.

-- Proof sketch: use the interval-control statement from Proposition `3-9-5` on the total product
-- `π.prod`, then apply Peiffer reductions to rewrite the formal product until every relator term
-- itself is supported in `[xₐ, x_b]`. The parenthetical product-preservation claim follows from
-- `prod_eq_of_peifferTransformations`.
/-- Proposition 3-11-4: if `(X₀; r)` is staggered, every term of a formal product `π` is a
positive relator conjugate, and the total product `π.prod` contains distinguished generators only
from the interval `[xₐ, x_b]`, then Peiffer transformations carry `π` to a formal product all of
whose relator terms are supported in that same interval. -/
