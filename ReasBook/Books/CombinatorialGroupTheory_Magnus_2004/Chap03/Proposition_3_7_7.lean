-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a Fuchsian complex for a group `G`, viewed through its minimal angles and
-- real-valued angle assignments on those minimal angles.
-- `core/canonical`: `FuchsianComplex` from Proposition `3-7-3` is the chapter owner for the
-- actual `2`-complex together with the action of `G` by automorphisms.
-- `bridge/view`: a minimal angle is a face corner, represented by a boundary star of the
-- underlying `2`-complex, and the action transports those corners through the existing complex
-- automorphisms.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `FuchsianComplex` from Proposition `3-7-3` is the upstream owner abstraction for Fuchsian
--    complexes in this chapter.
-- 2. `TwoComplex.BoundaryStar` from Proposition `3-3-4` is the project owner for face corners.
-- 3. `TwoComplex.AutAction` from Proposition `3-7-1` is the owner abstraction for the induced
--    action of `G` by automorphisms on the underlying complex.
-- 4. `TwoComplex.Hom.mapBoundaryStar` is the owner map for transporting a face corner along a
--    complex morphism, so invariance should be phrased through that transport rather than through
--    a duplicate local transport wrapper.
-- 5. `TwoComplex.AngleMeasure` from Proposition `3-7-5` is a different owner package: it records
--    the associated area measure of a `2`-complex angle measure, not the source-facing cornerwise
--    angle assignment of Proposition `3-7-7`, so it should not replace the main notion here.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- - primitive data: the minimal-angle carrier `Σ v, BoundaryStar v` attached to the underlying
--   complex, and a real-valued function on that carrier;
-- - derived API: the invariance predicate under the ambient `G`-action and the existence theorem.

/-- Proposition 3-7-7: every Fuchsian complex for `G` admits an angle measure that is invariant
under the action of `G`. -/
-- In the present formalization, an invariant angle measure is just a `G`-invariant real-valued
-- function on the minimal-angle carrier, so the constant zero function suffices.
