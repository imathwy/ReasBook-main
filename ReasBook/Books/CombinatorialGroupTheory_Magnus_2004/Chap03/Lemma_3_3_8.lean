-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: an ambient `1`-complex `K`, a family of subcomplexes `K_λ`, a vertex-labelling
-- into an indexed free product, and the resulting notion of a binding tie.
-- `core/canonical`: `OneComplex`, `OneComplex.Subcomplex`, `OneComplex.Hom`,
-- `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected (Quiver.Symmetrify _)`, `Quiver.Path (Quiver.Symmetrify _)`,
-- `CoprodI`, and `MonoidHom.range` are the owner abstractions for the ambient graph, the
-- subcomplexes, connectedness, ambient and
-- internal zigzag paths, and the target free product.
-- `bridge/view`: `Subcomplex.toOneComplex` and the canonical hom
-- `Subcomplex.iInterInclusion` convert the
-- source-facing subcomplex data to the canonical ambient/path owners.
--
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `OneComplex.Subcomplex` is the source-facing owner for the subcomplexes `K_λ`.
-- 2. `OneComplex.Hom` from Proposition `3-3-1` is the chapter owner for maps of carried
--    `1`-complexes, so the intersection inclusion should be phrased through that owner rather
--    than as a raw quiver prefunctor.
-- 3. `Quiver.IsStronglyConnected (Quiver.Symmetrify _)` is the canonical owner for connectedness
--    of a reversible `1`-skeleton.
-- 4. `Quiver.Path (Quiver.Symmetrify K)` is the canonical path owner specialized to
--    symmetrified `1`-complexes.
-- 5. `CoprodI`, `CoprodI.of`, and `MonoidHom.range` are the owner abstractions for
--    the indexed free product and its canonical factor subgroups.

/-- Lemma 3-3-8: in the labelled free-product setting, if the common intersection `⋂ K_λ` is not
connected, then any two distinct factors produce a binding tie in the chosen `i`-factor.

The source-facing data are the family `K_λ`, the ambient vertex-labelling into the indexed free
product, and the standard free-product property that endpoint displacements inside `K_λ` land in
the `λ`-factor subgroup. The trivial-image condition is derived by comparing the same endpoint pair
through two distinct factors, rather than assumed as an extra bridge hypothesis. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose two vertices of `⋂ K_λ` lying in different components. Since `Kᵢ` and `Kⱼ`
-- are connected, there are paths between these vertices inside each of the two factors. The two
-- endpoint displacements coincide by definition, while the labelled free-product hypotheses force
-- that common displacement to lie in the `i`- and `j`-factors respectively. Distinct free-product
-- factors intersect trivially, so the common displacement is `1`; the path in `Kᵢ` is therefore a
-- binding tie.
