open CategoryTheory groupHomology Rep

-- Primary domain: low-degree group homology attached to a free presentation.
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a free presentation `π : F →* G` with `F` free, kernel `N = π.ker`, and the
-- Hopf-formula identification of the second integral homology with `(N ∩ [F, F]) / [F, N]`.
-- `core/canonical`: the bundled trivial representation `Rep.trivial ℤ G ℤ`, the low-degree owner
-- object `groupHomology.H2` together with its `≅`-valued comparison API such as
-- `groupHomology.H2Iso`, the commutator subgroup `_root_.commutator F`, and the subgroup
-- commutator `⁅(⊤ : Subgroup F), π.ker⁆`.
-- `bridge/view`: the source quotient is viewed as an object of `ModuleCat ℤ` via `Additive`; a
-- helper commutativity instance records that this quotient is abelian.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `groupHomology.H2` and the comparison isomorphism pattern `groupHomology.H2Iso` are the
--    owner-side API for second group homology.
-- 2. `Rep.trivial ℤ G ℤ` is the canonical trivial integral `G`-representation.
-- 3. `_root_.commutator F` is the owner-side commutator subgroup `[F, F]`.
-- 4. `⁅(⊤ : Subgroup F), π.ker⁆` is the ambient-group realization of `[F, N]`.
-- 5. `Subgroup.subgroupOf` is the canonical way to form the denominator subgroup inside
--    `π.ker ⊓ commutator F`.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data are the free group `F`, the presentation map `π`, and the
-- surjectivity hypothesis. The quotient appearing in Hopf's formula is derived directly from
-- `π.ker` and the commutator constructions, so no wrapper around presentation data is introduced.
-- The later prose in the source item about free and amalgamated products is bibliographic
-- motivation rather than a separate atomic theorem statement, so only the explicit Hopf formula is
-- formalized here.
