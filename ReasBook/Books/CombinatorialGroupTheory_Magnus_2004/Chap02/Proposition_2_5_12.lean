-- Declarations for this item are recorded in this dedicated item file.

-- Primary domain: one-relator groups and free-product decompositions.
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a one-relator presentation on generators `x₁, …, xₙ`, together with the
-- hypothesis that the relator has minimal reduced length in its automorphism orbit and uses
-- exactly the first `k` generators.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup` for one-relator presentations, `MulAut (FreeGroup (Fin n))`
-- for automorphisms of the ambient free group, `reducedWordSupport` for reduced-word support, and
-- `Monoid.Coprod` for the free-product decomposition.
-- `bridge/view`: the source phrase “`G₁ = (x₁, …, x_k; r)`” is encoded by the canonical relator
-- obtained from `r` by the owner map `FreeGroup.lift` that keeps the first `k` generators and
-- sends the remaining ambient generators to `1`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup ({r} : Set (FreeGroup (Fin n)))` is the canonical one-relator owner object.
-- 2. `MulAut (FreeGroup (Fin n))` is the owner abstraction for `Aut(F)`.
-- 3. `reducedWordSupport` from Proposition `1-5-6` is the project's owner abstraction for the
--    basis letters occurring in the canonical reduced word of a free-group element.
-- 4. `Fin.castLE` and `Fin.castLEEmb` are the canonical initial-segment inclusions `Fin k ↪ Fin n`
--    used to embed the smaller relator support into the ambient free group.
-- 5. `Monoid.Coprod` with notation `G₁ ∗ G₂` is mathlib's owner abstraction for free products.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the relator `r`, the cutoff `k`, and the two source hypotheses. The
-- smaller relator, the induced one-relator factor on the first `k` generators, and the free
-- factor are derived canonical presentation-level objects.

-- Proof sketch: use the minimal-length hypothesis together with the exact support condition to
-- isolate the first `k` generators as the unique support of the relator. Rewrite the original
-- one-relator presentation as the free product of the smaller one-relator presentation on those
-- generators and the free group on the remaining generators. Then apply Magnus's
-- freely-indecomposable theorem to the smaller factor.
/-- Proposition 2-5-12: if the relator `r` in the one-relator presentation
`(x₁, …, xₙ; r)` has minimal reduced-word length in its automorphism orbit and its reduced-word
support is exactly the first `k` generators, then the presented group splits as the free product
of the one-relator group on those `k` generators and a free group on the remaining generators,
and the smaller one-relator factor is freely indecomposable. -/
