-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a one-relator group `G = (X; r)` whose defining relator is the commutator
-- `r = ⁅u, v⁆` of two words in the ambient free group on `X`.
-- `core/canonical`: Proposition `2-5-17`, namely
-- `isMulTorsionFree_presentedGroup_singleton_of_relator_not_properPower`, which is the chapter's
-- owner theorem turning a non-proper-power relator into torsion-freeness of the quotient.
-- `bridge/view`: this file specializes that owner theorem to the commutator relator `⁅u, v⁆`.
-- The nontrivial commutator case is handled by the commutator-specific non-proper-power input,
-- while the trivial commutator case is reduced to the canonical quotient `PresentedGroup ({1})`,
-- which is identified with the ambient free group.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup R` is mathlib's owner abstraction for a group defined by generators and
--    relators.
-- 2. `⁅u, v⁆` from the commutator API is the canonical owner notation for the relator `[u, v]`.
-- 3. `isMulTorsionFree_presentedGroup_singleton_of_relator_not_properPower` from Proposition
--    `2-5-17` is the chapter's owner theorem for torsion-freeness of a one-relator quotient.
-- 4. `Subgroup.normalClosure`, `Subgroup.closure_singleton_one`, and
--    `QuotientGroup.quotientBot` are the canonical owner APIs for rewriting the trivial-relator
--    quotient to `FreeGroup X`.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are only the generator type `X` and the words `u v : FreeGroup X`; the
-- commutator relator `⁅u, v⁆`, the one-relator quotient, and its torsion-free property are all
-- derived canonically from those data together with the owner theorem from Proposition `2-5-17`
-- and the canonical identification of the trivial-relator quotient with `FreeGroup X`.

/-- Proposition 2-5-19: if the one-relator group `G = (X; r)` has defining relator
`r = [u, v] = ⁅u, v⁆` for some words `u` and `v`, then `G` is torsion free. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply the torsion theorem for one-relator groups. Torsion in a one-relator
-- quotient can occur only when the defining relator is a proper power in the ambient free group.
-- If `⁅u, v⁆ ≠ 1`, then the commutator relator is not a proper power, so Proposition `2-5-17`
-- applies directly. If `⁅u, v⁆ = 1`, then the presentation has the trivial relator, so the
-- quotient is canonically the free group on `X`, hence torsion free.
