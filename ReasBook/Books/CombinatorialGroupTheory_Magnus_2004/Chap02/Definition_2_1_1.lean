-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a group `G`, a type `X` of defining generators, a set `R` of relators in the
-- free group on `X`, and the assertion that `(X; R)` presents `G` via a chosen equivalence
-- `PresentedGroup R ≃* G`.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup R`, `PresentedGroup.of`, `PresentedGroup.closure_range_of`,
-- `PresentedGroup.mk_eq_one_iff`, and `Subgroup.normalClosure`.
-- `bridge/view`: the chosen presentation equivalence transports the canonical generators of
-- `PresentedGroup R` to the defining generators in `G`, and `FreeGroup.lift` evaluates words in
-- those generators.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup R` is mathlib's owner abstraction for a group given by generators `X` and
--    relators `R`.
-- 2. `PresentedGroup.of` is the canonical image of a defining generator in the presented group.
-- 3. `PresentedGroup.closure_range_of` is the canonical statement that these images generate the
--    presented group.
-- 4. `PresentedGroup.mk_eq_one_iff` identifies the consequences of the relators with the normal
--    closure of `R`.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data are the generators `X`, the relator set `R`, and the chosen
-- identification `PresentedGroup R ≃* G`; the defining-generator subset of `G` and the
-- relator/consequence equations are derived from that canonical owner-side datum, so no parallel
-- alias for the equivalence is introduced.

is a chosen multiplicative equivalence from the canonical presented group `PresentedGroup R` to
