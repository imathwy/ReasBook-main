Primary domain: Fuchsian complexes, invariant angle measures, and the curvature formula attached
to a strictly quadratic power presentation of an `F`-group.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a chosen presentation `G = (X; R)` with relators `R = {s ^ m(s) : s ∈ S}`,
  a Fuchsian complex for `G`, and the boundary curvature of the faces of that complex.
- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup` is the owner for the chosen presentation,
  `IsStrictlyQuadraticSet` is the chapter owner for the strictly quadratic root family,
  and `FuchsianComplex.AngleMeasure.IsInvariant` from Proposition `3-7-7` is the owner predicate
  for invariant angle measures.
- `bridge/view`: `FGroupPowerPresentation` packages the exact power-presentation data used in the
  proposition, while `FuchsianComplex.FaceBoundaryGeometry` supplies the face type and the
  curvature of face boundaries on top of the existing `FuchsianComplex` owner.

Domain sampling:
1. `PresentedGroup R` from the chapter presentation API is the canonical owner for a concrete
   group presentation.
2. `IsStrictlyQuadraticSet` from Chapter `1` is the existing owner predicate for the hypothesis
   that the relator roots form a strictly quadratic family.
3. `TwoComplex.BoundaryStar` gives the face-corner carrier used in Proposition `3-7-7` for the
   minimal-angle type of a Fuchsian complex.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the generator type `X`, the finite root family `S`, the multiplicity
  function `m`, the identification of `G` with the presented group on relators `s ^ m(s)`, the
  Fuchsian complex `K`, and the face-boundary curvature operation on `K`;
- derived API: the curvature identity itself for invariant angle measures.

of the boundary of each face for any chosen angle measure. -/

  boundaryCurvature : AngleMeasure K → Face → ℝ

/-- Proposition 3-7-8: for a Fuchsian complex attached to a strictly quadratic power presentation,
the curvature of the boundary of any face with respect to an invariant angle measure is
`2π (|X| - ∑_{s ∈ S} 1 / m(s))`. -/
-- Proof sketch: by invariance it suffices to compute the face dual to the identity vertex of the
-- presentation complex. Decompose that face using the common barycentric subdivision, sum the
-- local contributions `π - α(D, g)` over the conjugates of each relator `s ^ {m(s)}`, and use the
-- strict quadraticity identity `∑ |s| = 2 |X|` to simplify the result.
