-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a 2-complex with its 1-skeleton, oriented faces, boundary cycles, inverse
-- faces, and the derived notions of a vertex lying on a face and of a boundary path.
-- `core/canonical`: `OneComplex` is the owner for the 1-skeleton, while
-- `Quiver.Path.CyclicPath`, `Quiver.Path.cyclicPath`, and the predicates from
-- Definition 3-2-3 are the owner API for cyclic boundary data in that skeleton.
-- `bridge/view`: the inverse-edge operation on a `OneComplex` induces the quiver-reversal
-- structure needed to talk about inverse loops and inverse boundary cycles in the skeleton.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `OneComplex` is the project owner abstraction for the textbook 1-skeleton.
-- 2. `Quiver.Path.Loop` is the canonical owner for based loops in the induced quiver.
-- 3. `Quiver.Path.CyclicPath` is the project owner for the basepoint-free cyclic boundary object.
-- 4. `Quiver.Path.IsCyclicallyReducedCycle` is the owner predicate for cyclically reduced
--    boundary cycles, while `Quiver.Path.IsSimple` remains the owner predicate on representatives
--    used to define simple boundary.
