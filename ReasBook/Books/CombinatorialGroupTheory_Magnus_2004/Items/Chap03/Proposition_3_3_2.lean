Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a connected `1`-complex `C`, a base vertex `v : C`, a subgroup
  `H ≤ π(C, v)`, and a connected covering of `C` whose induced map on the based fundamental
  group realizes exactly `H`.
- `core/canonical`: `OneComplex.Hom` is the owner abstraction for maps of `1`-complexes,
  `Quiver.Prefunctor.IsCovering` for `φ.toPrefunctor` is the canonical covering-side structure,
  `Hom.inducedFundamentalGroupHomOver` is the induced based fundamental-group homomorphism, and
  `Subgroup` is the owner abstraction for subgroups.
- `bridge/view`: the chosen vertex `v'` over `v` gives an equality `φ.toVertex v' = v`, which
  transports the canonical induced map to codomain `π(C, v)`.

Domain sampling:
1. `OneComplex.Hom` from Proposition `3-3-1` is the chapter owner for morphisms of `1`-complexes.
2. `Quiver.Prefunctor.IsCovering` for `Hom.toPrefunctor` is the owner predicate for coverings of
   the underlying quivers.
3. `Hom.inducedFundamentalGroupHomOver` is the canonical induced map on based fundamental groups.
4. `Subgroup` is the owner abstraction for subgroups of `π(C, v)`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the covering morphism `φ : Hom C' C` with its chosen lift `v'` of `v`, and the
  equality identifying the image of the induced homomorphism with `H`;
- derived API: injectivity of the induced homomorphism, which is already the canonical conclusion
  of Proposition `3-3-1` for any covering map, and hence should not be packaged as primitive
  output here.

/-- Proposition 3-3-2: every subgroup `H ≤ π(C, v)` is realized by a connected covering
`1`-complex over `C`, with a chosen vertex over `v`, such that the induced homomorphism
`π(C', v') → π(C, v)` has image exactly `H`. Injectivity is the canonical downstream consequence
of Proposition `3-3-1` for covering maps. -/
-- Proof sketch: choose a maximal tree in `C`, form the covering complex whose vertices are the
-- right cosets of `H`, use the canonical quiver covering map to show local bijectivity on stars,
-- and apply path lifting to identify the induced fundamental-group map with the subgroup `H`.
