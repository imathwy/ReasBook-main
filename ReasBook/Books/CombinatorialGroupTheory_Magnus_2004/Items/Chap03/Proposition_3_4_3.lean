Primary domain: coverings, automorphisms, and quotient maps of `1`- and `2`-complexes.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an actual Cayley complex `C(X; R)` realized by
  `PresentationCoordinates C R`,
  an actual presentation complex `K(X; R)` realized by `PresentationComplex.Coordinates K X R`,
  and the canonical map `C(X; R) → K(X; R)`.
- `core/canonical`: `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` is the owner for the Cayley-complex realization
  data, `PresentationComplex.Coordinates` is the owner for the presentation-complex realization
  data, `TwoComplex.Hom` and `TwoComplex.Hom.IsCoveringMap` are the owners for `2`-complex maps
  and coverings, `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected` from Proposition `3-4-2` is the owner for simple
  connectedness of the total space, and `TwoComplex.Hom.IsDeckTransformation` is the map-relative
  owner for automorphisms of the universal cover that descend to the base.
- `bridge/view`: `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.PresentationMap` is the thin bridge carrying the
  actual presentation complex `K(X; R)` and the canonical map `C(X; R) → K(X; R)` attached to a
  fixed Cayley-complex realization.

Domain sampling:
1. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` from Proposition `3-4-1` is the owner for the actual Cayley
   complex data on `C(X; R)`.
2. `TwoComplex.Hom` and `TwoComplex.Hom.IsCoveringMap` from Proposition `3-3-4` are the owners
   for maps and coverings of `2`-complexes.
3. `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected` from Proposition `3-4-2` is the owner for simple connectedness
   of the universal cover.
4. `ModifiedCayleyComplex.faceBoundary_word` from Proposition `3-7-1` shows the project style for
   realizing a `2`-complex by cell coordinates together with explicit face-boundary word data.
5. `CayleyComplex.automorphism_cellAction_eq_leftTranslation` from Proposition `3-4-1`
   classifies the induced cell action of label-preserving Cayley-complex automorphisms, so the
   quotient statement here must be phrased via automorphisms over the canonical map rather than
   via all automorphisms of the source.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: an actual Cayley-complex realization `coords`, an actual presentation-complex
  realization on some `K`, and the canonical comparison map `C(X; R) → K(X; R)` recording how the
  Cayley coordinates forget the group coordinate while preserving signed edge labels and relator
  labels;
- derived API: connectedness of the Cayley complex, the covering-map property of the canonical
  comparison, the resulting universal-covering property, and the quotient-by-deck-transformations
  statement.
