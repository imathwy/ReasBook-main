Primary domain: Fuchsian complexes, modified presentations, and dual modified Cayley complexes.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a Fuchsian complex for a group `G`, a modified presentation `(X, J; R)` of
  `G`, the associated modified Cayley complex, and the statement that this complex can be chosen
  dual to the given Fuchsian complex.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex` is the owner for the underlying `2`-complex geometry,
  `TwoComplex.Aut` is the owner for automorphisms of a `2`-complex,
  `TwoComplex.AutAction` is the owner for a group action by such automorphisms,
  `TwoComplex.GeometricFace` and `OneComplex.GeometricEdge` are the owners for unoriented faces
  and edges, and
  `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` is the owner for Cayley-type coordinates on an actual `2`-complex,
  `SignedLetter` is the chapter owner for signed ordinary generators,
  `PresentedGroup` is the canonical owner for the relators of a modified presentation, and
  `TwoComplex.VertexOnFace` is the owner for vertex-face incidence.
- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.Duality` records the duality data between two actual
  `2`-complexes together with their incidence compatibility, and
  `ModifiedCayleyComplex.RealizesFuchsianDuality` expresses the textbook equivariance statement
  for the dual vertices.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex` from Definition `3-2-4` is the owner abstraction for the actual complex `K`.
2. `TwoComplex.Aut` and its induced permutations from Proposition `3-4-1` are the natural owner
   abstractions for the group action on a Fuchsian complex.
3. `TwoComplex.AutAction` is the right owner for the group law on those automorphisms, so the
   induced geometric-face and geometric-edge permutations are derived API rather than primitive
   fields of `FuchsianComplex`.
4. `TwoComplex.GeometricFace`, `OneComplex.GeometricEdge`, and `TwoComplex.VertexOnFace` are the
   correct intrinsic carriers and incidence owners for duality and for the "without reflections"
   condition.
5. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` from Proposition `3-4-1` is the owner abstraction for an actual
   Cayley-type complex with the canonical left translations by `G`.
6. `SignedLetter` from Proposition `3-4-1` is the owner vocabulary for signed ordinary
   generators, so the modified relator alphabet should reuse it directly.
7. `PresentedGroup` is the canonical owner for saying that a relator family presents `G`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the actual Fuchsian `2`-complex, its action by automorphisms, the modified
  presentation data `(X, J; R)` together with the actual relator words, the involution condition
  on the reflection generators, the presentation equivalence to `G`, and the actual modified
  Cayley complex with Cayley coordinates and relator boundary words;
- derived API: the induced actions on geometric faces and edges, the generator/reflection values
  in `G`, the duality equivalences together with their incidence view, the vertex corresponding to
  a face under a duality, and the equivariance statement for those vertices.

`gD` is the translate by `g` of the vertex corresponding to `D`. This is exactly the owner
predicate `ModifiedCayleyComplex.RealizesFuchsianDuality`, so the numbered item is recorded as a

complex may be chosen to come from an ordinary presentation. -/
