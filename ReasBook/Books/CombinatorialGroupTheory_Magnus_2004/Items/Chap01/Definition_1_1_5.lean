Primary domain: projective objects in the category of groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: projective groups, expressed by lifting homomorphisms along surjective group
  homomorphisms.
- `core/canonical`: `CategoryTheory.Projective` on `GrpCat`.
- `bridge/view`: the concrete group-hom lifting statement obtained from the owner abstraction using
  `GrpCat.epi_iff_surjective`.

Domain sampling:
1. `CategoryTheory.Projective` is mathlib's owner predicate for projective objects.
2. `Projective.factorThru` and `Projective.factorThru_comp` are the canonical factorization API for
   maps out of a projective object through an epimorphism.
3. `GrpCat.epi_iff_surjective` is the category-specific bridge identifying epimorphisms in
   `GrpCat` with surjective group homomorphisms.
4. `Projective.factors` is the primitive existence statement; the theorem below is the derived
   source-facing reformulation in ordinary group-hom language.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive owner-side data are only the projective factorization property in `GrpCat`; the
explicit lifting statement for surjective homomorphisms is derived from that owner abstraction and
should remain a bridge theorem rather than a parallel owner definition.

/- Definition 1-1-5: a projective group is a projective object of `GrpCat`, equivalently a group
whose homomorphisms lift along surjective homomorphisms. -/
#check (Projective : GrpCat → Prop)

/-- A group is projective exactly when every homomorphism out of it lifts along surjective
group homomorphisms. -/
-- Proof sketch: use `GrpCat.epi_iff_surjective` to rewrite surjective homomorphisms as
-- epimorphisms in `GrpCat`, and then apply the defining factorization property of
-- `Projective`.
