-- Domain sampling for Whitehead automorphisms:
-- 1. `MulAut (FreeGroup X)` is the owner abstraction for automorphisms of the ambient free group.
-- 2. `SignedLetter X` is the project owner vocabulary for signed basis letters.
-- 3. `FreeGroup.mk [x]` is the canonical ambient free-group element represented by one signed
--    letter `x : SignedLetter X`.
-- 4. `SignedLetter` carries the owner involution on signed letters, written as `x⁻¹`.
-- Primitive data for Whitehead automorphisms of the second kind are therefore a multiplier
-- `a : SignedLetter X` together with a subset `A ⊆ X^{±1}` satisfying the textbook constraints
-- `a ∈ A` and `a⁻¹ ∉ A`; the four word-shapes are derived from the membership pattern of
-- `x` and `x⁻¹`.

/-- Proposition 1-4-25: if the automorphic image of a finite family of cyclic words under `α` has
minimal total cyclic length among all automorphic images, then `α` admits a factorization into
Whitehead automorphisms such that the successive prefix images strictly decrease total cyclic
length until the terminal minimum is reached, and thereafter keep that minimum fixed. -/
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the finite family `w : ι → CyclicWord X`, the automorphism
-- `α : MulAut (FreeGroup X)`, and the source set `Ω` of Whitehead automorphisms.
-- `core/canonical`: `CyclicWord X`, the owner automorphism group `MulAut (FreeGroup X)`, its
-- induced `MulAction` on `CyclicWord X` and on finite families `ι → CyclicWord X`, together
-- with ordinary `Fintype` sums of cyclic lengths.
-- `bridge/view`: `CyclicWord.map` transports the canonical action on conjugacy classes back to
-- reduced cyclic words, while `Whitehead.automorphisms` is the source-facing owner set `Ω`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `CyclicWord.toConjClasses` is the chapter's owner map from cyclic words to conjugacy classes.
-- 2. `CyclicWord.conjClassesEquiv` is the canonical equivalence used to transport the
--    automorphism action from conjugacy classes back to cyclic words.
-- 3. `ConjClasses.map` in mathlib is the canonical action of a homomorphism on conjugacy classes.
-- 4. The induced Pi-action gives the canonical owner action on finite families
--    `ι → CyclicWord X`, and `CyclicWord.totalLength` is already stated for arbitrary
--    `[Fintype ι]`, so no `Fin t`-specific family owner belongs in the public API here.
-- 5. `SignedLetter X` is the project owner vocabulary for letters of `X^{±1}`.
-- 6. `MulAut (FreeGroup X)` is the owner abstraction for automorphisms of the free group, while
--    the prefix dynamics are derived from `Whitehead.prefixAut`, the induced Pi-action, and
--    ordinary `Fintype` sums.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data is the family of cyclic words together with the ambient free-group
-- automorphism `α`; the terminal family `α • w`, the cyclic-word action, the total-length
-- functional, and the prefix-stage lengths are derived.
