-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a minimal strictly quadratic cyclic word `q`, a generator `x` occurring in
-- `q`, the specialization `x ↦ 1`, and the Whitehead-graph component count `k(q)`.
-- `core/canonical`: `CyclicWord X` as the chapter owner abstraction for cyclic words,
-- `SignedLetter X` from Proposition `1-7-8` as the Section 7 signed-basis vocabulary,
-- `CyclicWord.length` as the canonical size function, and `CyclicWord.conjClassesEquiv` as the
-- owner bridge that returns the specialized conjugacy class to its reduced cyclic-word
-- representative.
-- `bridge/view`: the specialization and Whitehead graph are derived from the canonical cyclic-word
-- owner, with only the raw `Cycle` edge/support formulas retained as an internal view needed for
-- unreduced downstream constructions.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `CyclicWord X` from Definition `1-4-17` is the chapter owner abstraction for cyclic words.
-- 2. `SignedLetter X` from Proposition `1-7-8` is the established Section 7 owner vocabulary for
--    signed basis letters, so this file reuses it directly.
-- 3. `CyclicWord.length` is the canonical size function on that owner abstraction.
-- 4. `CyclicWord.conjClassesEquiv` from Definition `1-4-17` is the owner equivalence returning
--    a conjugacy class to its canonical reduced cyclic-word representative, and `ConjClasses.map`
--    is the canonical specialization on that owner side.
-- 5. `CyclicWord.letters` and `CyclicWord.HasFullSupport` from Definition `1-4-17` are the owner
--    unsigned-support APIs, so support assumptions should remain separate from the meaning of
--    “minimal strictly quadratic”.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data here are the cyclic word `q` and the generator `x`. Signed-letter
-- occurrence counts, strict quadraticity, specialization, the Whitehead graph, and `k(q)` are all
-- derived from the owner cyclic-word API, while the support condition on `x` is expressed through
-- the owner unsigned-letter view `x ∈ q.letters`.

/-- Proposition 1-7-11: if `q` is a minimal strictly quadratic cyclic word and `x` occurs in `q`,
then setting `x` equal to `1` either makes the cyclic length drop by `2` and changes `k` by at
most `1`, or makes the cyclic length drop by `4` and leaves `k` unchanged. -/
-- Proof sketch: analyze the two occurrences of `x` in the Whitehead graph of `q`. If the
-- specialized cyclic word is already reduced after deleting those two letters, then the cyclic
-- length drops by `2`, and the resulting local graph surgery changes the number of connected
-- components by at most `1`. If the deletion creates one cyclic cancellation pair, then the
-- canonical cyclic reduction removes two further letters, so the total drop is `4` and the
-- induced graph surgery preserves the number of components.
