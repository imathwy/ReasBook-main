-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the regular/singular relator-set reduction relation between relator sets with
-- possibly different ambient generator types, together with the counted reduction-to-triviality
-- language attached to a relator set `W`.
-- `core/canonical`: the relator-set owner notation `Ir(W)`, the automorphism owner
-- `MulAut (FreeGroup ι)`, set image `α '' W`, the specialization map
-- `specializeWordSetAtGenerator`, and `Relation.ReflTransGen` as the canonical owner of finite
-- transformation sequences.
-- `bridge/view`: a regular transformation of relators is the canonical image of `W` under an
-- automorphism of the ambient free group, while a singular transformation is the canonical
-- specialization obtained by killing one generator. The sigma package of "ambient generator type
-- together with relator set" and the adjoining singular-step count are internal bookkeeping used
-- only to realize the public counted sequence predicate.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `Ir(W)` from Proposition `1-6-13` is the chapter owner abstraction for irreducibility rank.
-- 2. `ir_image_eq` from Proposition `1-6-13` is the canonical invariance statement for
--    regular transformations coming from automorphisms of the ambient free group.
-- 3. `specializeWordSetAtGenerator` from Proposition `1-6-14` is the canonical relator-set
--    construction for setting a generator equal to `1`.
-- 4. `GroupPresentation.TietzeExpansion` from Proposition `2-2-1` is the project pattern for
--    binder-indexed relations between relator sets with varying generator types, and
--    `Relation.ReflTransGen` is the canonical owner for finite step sequences.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source-facing data are the one-step regular and singular relator-set reductions.
-- The counted sequence predicate, reduction-to-triviality predicate, and minimum singular-step
-- invariant are derived from that owner relation by adjoining an internal singular-step count and
-- applying `Relation.ReflTransGen` and `sInf`.

-- Proof sketch: regular transformations preserve `Ir(W)` by Proposition `1-6-13`, while each
-- singular transformation can decrease `Ir(W)` by at most one by Proposition `1-6-14`. Reducing to
-- a trivial relator set leaves a free group on the surviving generators, whose irreducibility rank
-- is exactly that remaining rank. Therefore the optimal number of singular steps is precisely the
-- defect `n - Ir(W)`.
