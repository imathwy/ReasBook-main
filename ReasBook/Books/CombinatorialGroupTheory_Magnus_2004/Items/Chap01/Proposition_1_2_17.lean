Primary domain: reduced-word powers in free groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: powers of an element of a free group, measured relative to a chosen basis.
- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced`, `FreeGroup.toWord`, and `FreeGroup.norm`.
- `bridge/view`: `FreeGroupBasis.repr` transports the source-facing statement to the canonical
  free-group model.

Domain sampling:
1. `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced.flatten_replicate` is the owner theorem controlling powers of a
   cyclically reduced reduced word.
2. `FreeGroup.toWord_pow` is the owner evaluation theorem for reduced words of powers.
3. `FreeGroup.norm` is the owner reduced-word length function.
4. `FreeGroupBasis.repr` is the chapter's canonical bridge from an abstract free group with chosen
   basis to the concrete `FreeGroup` model.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: an element `w : FreeGroup α` and the proof that `w.toWord` is cyclically
  reduced;
- derived API: the exact reduced word of `w ^ n`, its linear norm growth, and the basis-level
  transport statement.
