-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: finite strictly quadratic sets `S` of reduced cyclic words, the textbook
-- invariant `k(S)`, and one-step attached elementary Nielsen transformations `S ↦ Sσ`.
-- `core/canonical`: `Finset (CyclicWord X)` together with the owner namespace
-- `CyclicWord.Finset`, `CyclicWord.length`, `CyclicWord.map`, and the single-word Whitehead-graph
-- constructions `edgesOfWord` and `wordSupport` from Proposition `1-7-11`.
-- `bridge/view`: the finite-system Whitehead graph `Σ(S)` is derived by taking the union of the
-- single-word Whitehead edges and supports over the owner finite system `S`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `CyclicWord` from Definition `1-4-17` is the chapter owner abstraction for reduced cyclic
--    words.
-- 2. `CyclicWord.length` is the canonical size function on one reduced cyclic word, so the total
--    size `|S|` should be derived in the owner finite-system namespace.
-- 3. `edgesOfWord` and `wordSupport` from Proposition `1-7-11` are the owner one-word
--    Whitehead-graph constructions reused here for finite systems.
-- 4. `CyclicWord.map` from Definition `1-4-17` is the owner action of `Aut(FreeGroup X)` on
--    reduced cyclic words.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data are the finite set `S` of reduced cyclic words and the attached
-- elementary Nielsen step. The total length, signed-occurrence counts, strict quadraticity
-- predicate, and invariant `k(S)` are then derived directly from the owner cyclic-word and graph
-- APIs.

/-- Proposition 1-7-9: if `σ` is an attached elementary Nielsen transformation of the finite
strictly quadratic set `S` of reduced cyclic words, then either `|Sσ| = |S|` and
`k(Sσ) = k(S)`, or `|Sσ| = |S| - 2` and `k(Sσ) = k(S) - 1`. -/
-- Proof sketch: write the attached move in the canonical form `x ↦ x y^ε`, so some member of `S`
-- contains the part `x y^{-ε}`. The second occurrence of `x` determines whether the local surgery
-- on the Whitehead graph merely reroutes two arcs or collapses a 2-cycle. In the first case both
-- the total cyclic length and `k(S)` are unchanged; in the second, one cancellation pair is
-- removed, so the total length drops by `2` and the number of connected components drops by `1`.
