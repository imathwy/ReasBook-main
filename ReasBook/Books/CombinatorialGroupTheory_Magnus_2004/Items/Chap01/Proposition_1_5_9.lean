-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a finite basis `basis : FreeGroupBasis X F`, a finite set
-- `S : Finset (CyclicWord X)`, and the subgroup of `Aut(F)` fixing each cyclic word in `S`.
-- `core/canonical`: `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` as mathlib's owner notion of admitting a finite
-- presentation, together with the basis-induced `Aut(F)`-action `basis.cyclicWordMulAction` and
-- the owner subgroup `MulAction.fixingSubgroup`.
-- `bridge/view`: a tuple `U : Fin m → CyclicWord X` presents the same finite collection as
-- `Finset.univ.image U`, and its Pi-action stabilizer is exactly the fixing subgroup of that
-- finite set.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `FreeGroupBasis.cyclicWordMulAction` from Proposition `1-5-2` is the owner basis-induced
--    `Aut(F)`-action on cyclic words over `X`.
-- 2. `MulAction.stabilizer` and `mem_stabilizer_iff` are mathlib's owner API for point
--    stabilizers.
-- 3. `MulAction.fixingSubgroup` and `mem_fixingSubgroup_iff` are mathlib's owner API for
--    pointwise fixers of a set.
-- 4. `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` is the owner notion of finite presentability.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data are the basis and the finite set `S`; the fixing subgroup is derived
-- canonically from `basis.cyclicWordMulAction`, while the tuple presentation
-- `U : Fin m → CyclicWord X` is only a bridge.
-- Proof sketch: McCool's algorithm constructs a finite generating set and a finite relator set for
-- the subgroup of automorphisms fixing the finite collection pointwise; this is exactly the data
-- needed to prove the canonical owner property `Group.IsFinitelyPresented`.
