Primary domain: algorithmic group theory for recursively presented groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a recursive presentation `(X; R)` together with the simplicity of the presented
  group determined by that presentation.
- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup R` is the owner object for the group defined by the relators,
  while `GroupPresentation.IsRecursive`, `GroupPresentation.HasSolvableWordProblem`, and
  `IsSimpleGroup` are the owner predicates for the hypotheses and conclusion.
- `bridge/view`: if `(X; R)` is given as a presentation of an ambient group `G` via
  `P : PresentedGroup R ≃* G`, then simplicity of `G` transports back to `PresentedGroup R`
  through `P`.

Domain sampling:
1. Definition `2-1-1` uses `PresentedGroup R` and `PresentedGroup R ≃* G` as the canonical owner
   object and presentation bridge.
2. `GroupPresentation.IsRecursive R` is the chapter owner for recursive enumerability of relators.
3. `GroupPresentation.HasSolvableWordProblem R` is the owner predicate for the conclusion.
4. `MulEquiv.isSimpleGroup_congr` is mathlib's canonical explicit transport of simplicity across
   a presentation equivalence.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data are the generator type `X` and relator set `R`; the ambient group `G`
and a presentation equivalence `PresentedGroup R ≃* G` are derived bridge data used only to
transport simplicity, so they do not remain in the main theorem.

/-- Theorem 4-3-7: if a recursive presentation `(X; R)` presents a simple group, equivalently if
its canonical presented group `PresentedGroup R` is simple, then `(X; R)` has solvable word
problem. -/
-- Proof sketch: for an input word `w`, enumerate in parallel the words trivial in the original
-- presentation and the words trivial in the quotient obtained by adjoining `w` as an extra
-- relator. Simplicity implies that the second quotient is trivial exactly when `w` is nontrivial
-- in the original group, so one of the two enumerations eventually certifies the answer.
