Primary domain: bipolar structures on groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: products `g * h` of irreducible sector elements with `g ∈ XY` and `h ∈ YZ`.
- `core/canonical`: `BipolarStructure`, its fixed subgroup `B.F`, its sector family `B X Y`, and
  the sector-factorization predicate `HasSectorFactorization`.
- `bridge/view`: the chapter-facing irreducibility predicate `B.IsIrreducible g` together with the
  union `(B.F : Set G) ∪ B X Z`, which records the textbook phrase “an irreducible element of
  `F ∪ XZ`” without introducing a surrogate wrapper.

Domain sampling:
1. `BipolarStructure` is the owner abstraction for the bipolar axioms and sector notation.
2. `B.IsIrreducible g` from Definition `4-6-1` is the chapter-facing owner for irreducibility.
3. `HasSectorFactorization` is the primitive owner-side predicate for admissible sector
   decompositions.
4. The subgroup piece is used canonically through the subgroup-to-set coercion `(B.F : Set G)`.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data are the bipolar structure `B`, poles `X Y Z`, elements `g h`, their
sector-membership assumptions, and the primitive factorization predicate behind irreducibility.
The public source-facing statement uses the derived owner predicate `B.IsIrreducible` for both the
inputs and the output, while the union-membership conclusion remains the direct set-level view.

/-- Lemma 4-6-3: if `g ∈ XY` and `h ∈ YZ` are both irreducible, meaning that neither admits a
length-two sector factorization, then `gh` is an irreducible element of `F ∪ XZ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: Lemma `4-6-2` gives the membership of `g * h` in `F ∪ XZ`. If `g * h` admitted a
-- length-two sector factorization, rewrite `g = p * (q * h⁻¹)` and use irreducibility of `h` to
-- show `q * h⁻¹ ∈ F`; then the bipolar axioms force `g` and `h` into incompatible sectors,
-- contradicting the irreducibility assumptions.
