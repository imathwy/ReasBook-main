Primary domain: Bass-LinearRepresentations_Serre_1977 type decompositions of groups with bipolar structures.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a group admitting a bipolar structure, and the two alternative decompositions
  from the theorem, namely a nontrivial amalgamated free product or an HNN extension.
- `core/canonical`: `Nonempty (BipolarStructure G)`, `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong`, and
  `HNNExtension G₀ A B φ`.
- `bridge/view`: a multiplicative equivalence from the ambient group onto one of those canonical
  owner constructions.

Domain sampling:
1. `BipolarStructure` from Definition `4-6-1` is the project owner for the bipolar axioms.
2. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong` from Definition `4-2-9` is the chapter-facing owner for a
   two-factor free product with amalgamation.
3. `HNNExtension G₀ A B φ` is mathlib's canonical owner abstraction for HNN extensions.
4. `MulEquiv` is the canonical API for identifying the ambient group with one of these
   constructions.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public content is the ambient group `G` together with either a bipolar structure or
one of the two source-facing decomposition data sets appearing directly in the theorem statement.
The exact subgroup pieces and stable-letter data belong to those existential alternatives, while
the theorem itself is the direct equivalence between `Nonempty (BipolarStructure G)` and
admitting one of the two canonical owner-level decomposition types.

section

/-- Theorem 4-6-5: a group has a bipolar structure if and only if it is either a nontrivial free
product with amalgamation, including the ordinary free product case, or an HNN extension. -/
-- Proof sketch: for the forward direction, build the subgroups `G₁` and `G₂` from the fixed part
-- and the irreducible sector pieces of a bipolar structure, then distinguish whether the sector
-- `EE*` is empty or not to obtain respectively an amalgamated-product or HNN-extension
-- decomposition. For the reverse direction, use the canonical bipolar structures constructed
-- earlier for amalgamated free products and for HNN extensions.
