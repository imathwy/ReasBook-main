Primary domain: curvature estimates for planar `[p, q]` maps whose connected components are discs
or annuli.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.HasSimplyConnectedOrAnnularComponents`,
  expressing that the planar map itself admits a finite connected-component decomposition whose
  components are either simply connected or annular in the induced planar embedding.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsComponentDecomposition` is the owner abstraction for
  the primitive component data, while `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected` and
  `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.HasAnnularBoundaryCycles` are the owner predicates for the two
  allowed component shapes.
- `bridge/view`: `TwoComplex.fullSubcomplex` is the intrinsic ambient subcomplex on which the
  component decomposition lives, and `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.restrictToSubcomplex` is the
  canonical restriction bridge to the induced embedding on each listed component.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsComponentDecomposition` from Proposition `3-9-1` is the owner
   abstraction for the finite component decomposition.
2. `TwoComplex.fullSubcomplex` from Definition `5-1-5` is the canonical ambient subcomplex
   carrying all cells of the map, so the whole-map component decomposition should live there
   rather than behind an extra `S`.
3. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.restrictToSubcomplex` from Definition `5-1-1` is the
   canonical restriction bridge for the induced embedding on each listed component.
4. `TwoComplex.IsSimplyConnected` from Proposition `3-4-2` is the owner predicate for the
   simply connected components.
5. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.HasAnnularBoundaryCycles` from Lemma `5-5-1` is the owner
   predicate for annular boundary components in a planar realization.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the planar embedding `embedding`, positive integers `p` and `q`
  satisfying `1 / p + 1 / q = 1 / 2`, the `[p, q]` hypothesis, and the existence of a finite
  component decomposition of the ambient map whose pieces satisfy one of the two owner
  component-shape hypotheses;
- derived API: the two inequalities `(6.1)` and `(6.2)` bounding boundary edges and boundary
  vertices by the boundary-vertex defect sum.

-- Proof sketch: rewrite formula `(3.1)` componentwise using the reciprocal relation
-- `1 / p + 1 / q = 1 / 2`, choose the component decomposition supplied by
-- `embedding.HasSimplyConnectedOrAnnularComponents`, and apply the induced component embedding
-- `embedding.restrictToSubcomplex (components i)` on the annular branch. A simply
-- connected component contributes Euler
-- characteristic `1` while an annular component contributes `0`. The `[p, q]` inequalities make
-- the interior-vertex and region-defect terms nonpositive, giving `(6.1)`; then delete isolated
-- boundary vertices and compare the remaining boundary vertices with boundary edges to obtain
-- `(6.2)`.
/-- Lemma 5-6-1: if a `[p, q]` map admits a finite component decomposition in which every
component is either simply connected or annular in the induced restricted embedding, then the
boundary edge-count and boundary vertex-count satisfy formulas `(6.1)` and `(6.2)`. -/
