Primary domain: finite small-cancellation presentations coming from standard alternating knot
projections.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a knot `K : Knot`, a chosen projection `P : K.Projection`, and the predicates
  saying that `P` is standard and alternating, together with the canonical presentation data
  already attached to `P`.
- `core/canonical`: `K.presentationRelators P` and `K.presentationEquiv P` reuse the project owner
  `PresentedGroup R ≃* K.knotGroup` for the canonical presentation of the knot group determined by
  `P`, while `C(4)[ofFreeGroup (Fin n), R]` and `T(4)[ofFreeGroup (Fin n), R]` are the Chapter `5`
  owner predicates expressing the small-cancellation conclusion on that relator set.
- `bridge/view`: this file is exactly the bridge from standard/alternating projection hypotheses
  to the Chapter `5` small-cancellation properties of the canonical presentation attached to that
  projection.

Domain sampling:
1. `Knot` in this file is the source-facing owner for a knot, its projections, and the canonical
   presentation attached to each projection.
2. `PresentedGroup R ≃* K.knotGroup` from Definition `2-1-1` is the project's canonical owner for
   a finite presentation of the knot group, and it is recorded here as `K.presentationEquiv P`.
3. `FreeGroupBasis.condition_c`, written `C(4)[FreeGroupBasis.ofFreeGroup (Fin n), R]`, from
   Definition `5-2-2` is the owner predicate for the `C(4)` conclusion.
4. `FreeGroupBasis.condition_t`, written `T(4)[FreeGroupBasis.ofFreeGroup (Fin n), R]`, from
   Definition `5-2-3` is the owner predicate for the `T(4)` conclusion.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the knot `K`, the projection `P : K.Projection`, and the predicates
  `K.IsStandardProjection` and `K.IsAlternatingProjection`, together with the canonical
  projection-attached presentation data `K.presentationRank P`, `K.presentationRelators P`, and
  `K.presentationEquiv P`;
- derived API: finiteness and the canonical `C(4)` and `T(4)` owner predicates for that attached
  relator set.

-- Proof sketch: for a standard alternating projection, its canonical Wirtinger-type presentation
-- is finite. The relators of that canonical presentation have the combinatorial form needed for
-- the Chapter `5` small-cancellation analysis, giving `C(4)` and `T(4)` on the canonical
-- free-group basis.
/-- Lemma 5-8-1: the canonical presentation attached to a standard alternating projection of a
knot is finite and satisfies `C(4)` and `T(4)`. -/
