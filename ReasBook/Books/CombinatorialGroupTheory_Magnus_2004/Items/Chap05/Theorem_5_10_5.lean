Primary domain: the explicit Section `10` small-cancellation product built from a countable group
and the cyclic groups of orders `5` and `7`.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the chosen enumeration `enumerate : ℕ → H`, the explicit relators `r₀, r₁, …`
  in `H * C₅ * C₇`, and the resulting quotient group.
- `core/canonical`: `Monoid.CoprodI` is the owner for the three-factor free product,
  `Monoid.CoprodI.condition_c_prime` is the owner predicate for the `C'(1 / 10)` hypothesis,
  `IsHopfian`, `IsCohopfian`, `Subgroup.center`, and `JA(_)` are the owner predicates for the
  resulting abstract group properties.
- `bridge/view`: `Monoid.Coprod.lift` gives the canonical map from `C₅ * C₇` into the quotient,
  and the three factor embeddings are the obvious compositions with the quotient map.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.CoprodI` from mathlib is the canonical owner for the free product of an indexed family
   of groups, and Section `10` already phrases small-cancellation over free products with that
   owner in [Theorem_5_10_1](/volume/math/AI4M/users/zcwang/bookrepo/CombinatorialGroupTheory_Magnus_2004/CombinatorialGroupTheory_Magnus_2004/Items/Chap05/Theorem_5_10_1.lean).
2. `Monoid.CoprodI.condition_c_prime` and its notation `C'(\lambda)[R]` are the chapter owner
   APIs for the symmetrized small-cancellation hypothesis.
3. `IsHopfian` from [Proposition_1_3_5](/volume/math/AI4M/users/zcwang/bookrepo/CombinatorialGroupTheory_Magnus_2004/CombinatorialGroupTheory_Magnus_2004/Items/Chap01/Proposition_1_3_5.lean)
   is the owner predicate for the Hopfian conclusion, and the same file now houses the matching
   cohopfian owner.
4. `MulAut.innerAutomorphismSubgroup` from
   [Proposition_1_4_5](/volume/math/AI4M/users/zcwang/bookrepo/CombinatorialGroupTheory_Magnus_2004/CombinatorialGroupTheory_Magnus_2004/Items/Chap01/Proposition_1_4_5.lean)
   is the canonical owner for “every automorphism is inner”, and the textbook notation `JA(G)` is
   the source-facing theorem surface for that owner, so completeness is expressed by the pair
   `Subgroup.center G = ⊥` and `JA(G) = ⊤`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive source data: the group `H` and the chosen sequence `enumerate : ℕ → H`;
- canonical derived data: the three-factor free product, the explicit relators, the relator set,
  the quotient map, and the induced factor maps;
- derived API: the `C'(1 / 10)` statement, the quotient-of-`C₅ * C₇` surjection, the three factor
  embeddings, and the Hopfian/complete/cohopfian conclusions.

-- Proof sketch: the same analysis of the images of `x` and `y` shows that every automorphism is

-- Proof sketch: if `H` has no element of order `5`, an injective endomorphism must send the
