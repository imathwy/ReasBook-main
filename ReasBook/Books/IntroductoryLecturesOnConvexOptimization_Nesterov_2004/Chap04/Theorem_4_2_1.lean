/- Theorem 4.2.1 lies in the chapter's constrained uniform-convexity domain on real normed spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* project `argmin[Q] f` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`
* project `uniformConvexPowerModulus` in `Chap04/Definition_4_2_8`
* mathlib `UniformConvexOn`
* mathlib `exists_nat_one_div_lt`

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the lower bound produced by uniform convexity at a constrained minimizer
* core/canonical: `xStar ∈ argmin[Q] d` together with
  `UniformConvexOn Q (uniformConvexPowerModulus σp p) d`
* bridge/view: the segmentwise comparison inequalities obtained by applying the owner predicate to
  convex combinations of `xStar` and `x`

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `Q`, objective `d`, and modulus parameters `σp`, `p`
* the canonical owner predicate `UniformConvexOn Q (uniformConvexPowerModulus σp p) d`
* the canonical constrained minimizer witness `xStar ∈ argmin[Q] d`

Derived API:
* feasibility and minimality of `xStar` from `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff`
* convexity of `Q` from `UniformConvexOn`
* lower bounds obtained by evaluating uniform convexity along the segment from `xStar` to `x`
  and letting the segment parameter tend to `0`

Using `argmin[Q] d` is essential here: `IsMinOn d Q xStar` alone does not encode the feasibility
fact `xStar ∈ Q`, but both the textbook meaning of “minimizer on `Q`” and the owner-side proof do.

/-- Theorem 4.2.1: if `xStar ∈ argmin[Q] d` and `d` is uniformly convex on `Q` with modulus
`r ↦ (1 / p) * σp * r^p`, then `d x ≥ d xStar + (σp / p) * ‖x - xStar‖^p`
for all `x ∈ Q`. -/
