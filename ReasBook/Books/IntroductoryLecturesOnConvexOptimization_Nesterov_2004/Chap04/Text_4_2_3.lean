/- Text 4.2.3 lies in the real-Hilbert-space Hessian domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `hessian` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the chapter owner for the intrinsic Hessian operator
* `fderiv_gradient_isSymmetric_of_contDiffAt` in `Chap01/Theorem_1_4_19`, the chapter symmetry
  bridge for `C²` Hessians
* `InnerProductSpace.toDualMap`, the canonical forward Riesz map into the strong dual
* `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.isSelfAdjoint`, the canonical bridge from symmetry to self-adjointness

Owner abstraction:
* core/canonical: `hessian f x`
* bridge/view: `toDualMap ∘ hessian f x`

Primitive data:
* `f`
* `x`
* differentiability of `∇ f` at `x`
* `ContDiffAt ℝ 2 f x`

Derived API:
* the dual-valued Hessian view `toDualMap ∘ hessian f x`
* its pointwise pairing formula
* its derivative formula for the dual-valued gradient map
* self-adjointness of `hessian f x`

This file therefore reuses the chapter owner `hessian f x` directly. The dual-valued formulation
appearing in the text is kept only as a thin bridge via the forward Riesz map `toDualMap`
(equivalently the forward direction of `toDual`), rather than as a second public Hessian owner. -/

/-- Applying the dual-valued Hessian bridge `toDualMap ∘ hessian f x` to a direction `u` and then
to a test vector `v` gives the Hessian pairing at `x`. -/

/-- Text 4.2.3: if `f` is twice differentiable at `x`, then the Hessian at `x` is the continuous
linear operator from the primal space `E` to the continuous dual `E⋆` obtained by differentiating
the gradient and composing with the Riesz identification `E ≃ E⋆`. -/
-- Proof sketch: view `y ↦ ∇ f y` as the first derivative of `f`, compose its derivative at `x`
-- with the forward Riesz map `InnerProductSpace.toDualMap`, and apply the chain rule.

/-- If `f` is `C²` at `x`, then the intrinsic Hessian operator `hessian f x` is self-adjoint. -/
-- Proof sketch: identify the Hessian with the second derivative of `f`; Schwarz symmetry for the
-- second derivative gives a symmetric bilinear form, and on a real Hilbert space this is
-- equivalent to self-adjointness of the associated continuous linear operator.
