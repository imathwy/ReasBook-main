variable {n k p : ℕ}

local notation "E" => EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)
open scoped CoordinateSubspace

-- Proof sketch: unfold `fk` on both sides. If `x ∈ coordinateSubspace k n`,
-- then `mem_coordinateSubspace_iff` says that every coordinate with index at least `k` vanishes,
-- so the extra adjacent-difference terms and tail terms introduced when passing from `f_k` to
-- `f_{k+p}` are all zero, while the shared terms and the linear term `-x^{(1)}` are unchanged.
/-- Lemma 4.3.2: if `x` lies in the coordinate subspace `ℝ^{k,n}`, then enlarging the hard-instance
index from `k` to `k + p` does not change the value of the textbook function `f_k`. -/
