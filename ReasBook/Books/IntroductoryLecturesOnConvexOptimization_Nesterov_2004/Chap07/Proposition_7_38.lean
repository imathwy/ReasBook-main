noncomputable section

/- Proposition 7.38 lies in Chapter 7's mixed-accuracy / scalar iteration-bound domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `relativeScaleIterationBound` in `Proposition_7_40`, the sibling Chapter 7 owner for the
  logarithmic iteration budget in the same quasi-Newton complexity lane;
- `relativeScaleUniformIterationBound` in `Proposition_7_40`, the companion dimension-free
  comparison owner for that sibling bound;
- `relativeScaleIterationBound_lt_uniformBound` in `Proposition_7_40`, the matching strict
  comparison theorem, which makes the strictness hypotheses for the logarithmic estimate explicit;
- `mixedAccuracyIterationCountBound` in `Definition_7_91`, the direct downstream recall surface
  that treats the present file as the owner source.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the textbook mixed-accuracy iteration budget `N_n(ε, δ)`;
- core/canonical: the scalar owner `mixedAccuracyIterationCountBound`;
- bridge/view: the expansion theorem
  `mixedAccuracyIterationCountBound_def` and the dimension-free comparison owner
  `mixedAccuracyUniformIterationCountBound`.

Primitive data:
- the dimension `n : ℕ+`;
- the constants `L`, `R`, `ε`, and `δ`.

Derived API:
- the logarithmic expansion of `N_n(ε, δ)`;
- the dimension-free comparison quantity `N_∞(ε, δ)`;
- the strict comparison theorem between the finite-dimensional and dimension-free bounds.

The earlier version let the owner depend on `n : ℕ`, which admits the non-source case `n = 0`,
and stated the strict comparison without the nonvanishing hypothesis `L * R ≠ 0` that the strict
logarithmic inequality actually needs. This refinement keeps the same mathematical formulas while
moving the public surface to the faithful positive-dimension owner level already used by the
sibling bound file `Proposition_7_40`.

-- Proof sketch: write `mixedAccuracyIterationCountBound n L R ε δ` as

/-- Proposition 7.38: for `ε > 0` and `δ > 0`, the mixed-accuracy iteration bound
`N_n(ε, δ)` from `(7.4.20)` is strictly less than the dimension-free bound
`N_∞(ε, δ) = L² R² / (2 ε δ)` whenever `L R ≠ 0`. -/
