local notation "DimPair" => ℕ × ℕ

/- Proposition 7.4 lies in the chapter's support-function smoothing / one-step work asymptotics
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `SupportFunctionSmoothingMethod` in `Algorithm_7_3`, the chapter owner of Method `S_N(R)`;
- mathlib `Asymptotics.IsBigO`, the canonical asymptotic owner behind `f =O[l] g`;
- `restrictedDimensionFilter` in `Proposition_7_6.lean`, the chapter owner of the admissible
  dimension regime `0 < p < n (n + 1) / 2` with `n → ∞`;
- `frobeniusGramPreliminaryArithmeticWorkBound` in `Proposition_7_5.lean`, the nearby
  source-facing work owner for the Frobenius-Gram subroutine that contributes to one step of the
  method.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the direct one-step work profile
  `(n, p) ↦ gradientWork (n, p) + projectionWork (n, p) + auxiliaryWork (n, p)`;
- core/canonical: `Asymptotics.IsBigO` on `restrictedDimensionFilter`;
- bridge/view: none beyond reading the source prose as the sum of its three component costs.

Primitive data:
- the three component cost profiles for one step of the method.

Derived API:
- the final `=O` bound by `n^2 (n + p)` on the chapter's restricted-dimension filter.

There is no genuine upstream owner in this chapter for the arithmetic work of one Algorithm 7.3
iteration. The previous version introduced a namespace-packaged alias for the sum of three
arbitrary profiles, but that alias carried no additional method data and violated the no-wrapper
rule. This refinement therefore keeps the proposition directly on the source-facing sum profile
while still reusing the canonical filter owner `restrictedDimensionFilter` from Proposition 7.6.

-- Proof sketch: add the three assumed `O`-bounds for the gradient, projection, and auxiliary
-- vector computations. On the restricted regime `p < n (n + 1) / 2`, the quadratic term `p^2`
-- is absorbed by `n^3 + n^2 p`, and `n^3 + n^2 p = n^2 (n + p)`.
/-- Helper for Proposition 7.4: the mixed gradient/projection source profile `p n^2 + n^3` is
dominated by the target scale `n^2 (n + p)`. -/
