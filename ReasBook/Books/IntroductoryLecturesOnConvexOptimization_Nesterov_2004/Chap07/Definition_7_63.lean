/- Definition 7.63 lies in the chapter's saddle-slice / primal-dual value domain.

Mandatory domain-style sampling before refinement:
- `SaddlePointRepresentation` and `SaddlePointRepresentation.objective_eq` in
  `Chap07/Definition_7_59`, the attained-inner-minimum owner for saddle representations;
- `partialInfProjection` in `Chap03/Theorem_3_1_2_3`, the canonical owner of unconstrained
  fiberwise infima in `EReal`;
- `maximalValueOn` in `Chap07/Definition_7_56`, the chapter owner of maximization values in
  `EReal`;
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.objective` and `StructuredObjectiveModel.adjointObjective` in
  `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the nearby saddle-slice owners for `sup` and `inf` values.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the primal and dual slice-value owners attached to a raw saddle map `Ψ₀`;
- core/canonical: `partialInfProjection (Set.univ : Set (P × Ω))` for the primal infimum and
  `maximalValueOn (Set.univ : Set P)` for the dual supremum;
- bridge/view: the `sInf` / `sSup` slice-expansion theorems below.

Primitive data:
- the saddle map `Ψ₀ : Ω → P → ℝ`.

Derived API:
- the faithful `EReal`-valued primal objective `saddlePointObjective Ψ₀`;
- the faithful `EReal`-valued dual function `saddlePointDualFunction Ψ₀`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the two slice-value functions from Definition 7.63;
- core/canonical: `partialInfProjection` and `maximalValueOn` at the faithful `EReal` layer;
- bridge/view: the evaluation lemmas below.

Definition 7.63 does not assume the inner minima are attained, so the stronger Chapter 7 owner
`SaddlePointRepresentation` from Definition 7.59 is not the main entry here. The previous public
definitions recreated raw real-valued `sInf` / `sSup` slice functions, which loses the chapter's
faithful treatment of empty or unbounded fibers. This refinement keeps the source-facing names but
places them directly on the canonical `EReal` owners `partialInfProjection` and
`maximalValueOn`; the textbook slice formulas remain only as expansion theorems.
