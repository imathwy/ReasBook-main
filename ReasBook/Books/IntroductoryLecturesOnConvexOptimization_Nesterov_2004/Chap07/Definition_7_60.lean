/- This item belongs to the Chapter 7 saddle-representation / selected-subgradient domain.

Relevant owner declarations:
- `SaddlePointRepresentation` in `Definition_7_59`;
- `argmin[Q]` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`;
- `mem_subdifferentialWithin_partialInfProjection_realPart_of_mem_argmin_of_subgradient` in
  `Chap03/Theorem_3_1_25`.

The source-facing auxiliary data are:
- a minimizing branch `w : P → S` for the saddle slices `Ψ(x, ·)`;
- a chosen first-argument saddle subgradient evaluated along that branch.

The canonical owner remains `SaddlePointRepresentation`; the minimizer-selection predicate and the
selected subgradient field are thin source-facing layers over that owner. -/
