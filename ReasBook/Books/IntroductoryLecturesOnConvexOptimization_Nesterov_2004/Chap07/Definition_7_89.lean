/- Definition 7.89 lies in Chapter 7's scalar mixed-accuracy / approximate-solution domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `IsApproximateSolution` in `Chap03/Definition_3_34`, the scalar objective-gap owner relative to a
  chosen minimizer;
- `IsRelativeAccuracy` in `Chap07/Definition_7_1`, the chapter owner for pure relative accuracy;
- `IsMixedApproximateSolution` in `Chap07/Definition_7_90`, the direct downstream optimization
  notion that should derive its scalar accuracy data from this file instead of re-packaging it.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the scalar mixed `(ε, δ)`-accuracy relation between `hatf xBar` and `hatf xStar`;
- core/canonical: a direct `Prop` on `hatf`, `xStar`, `ε`, `δ`, and `xBar`;
- bridge/view: the constrained mixed-approximate-solution predicate in Definition 7.90.

Primitive data:
- the objective `hatf`;
- the reference point `xStar`;
- the accuracy parameters `ε` and `δ`;
- the comparison point `xBar`.

Derived API:
- the projection theorems `HasMixedAccuracy.epsilon_pos`,
  `HasMixedAccuracy.delta_mem_Ioo`, and `HasMixedAccuracy.mixed_accuracy_bound`;
- the expansion theorem `hasMixedAccuracy_iff`.

The previous version packaged three scalar inequalities as a typeclass and then re-exposed the
same conjunction through `Fact`. Those inequalities are already the full mathematical content, so
the owner surface should be the direct `Prop`, matching the chapter style for scalar
approximate-solution notions. -/

/-- Definition 7.89: `xBar` has mixed `(ε, δ)`-accuracy for the objective `hatf` with respect to
the reference point `xStar` when `ε > 0`, `δ ∈ (0, 1)`, and
`(1 - δ) * hatf xBar ≤ hatf xStar + ε`. -/

-- Proof sketch: unpack the three fields of `HasMixedAccuracy` in one direction, and in the
-- other direction build the structure from the displayed positivity assumptions and inequality.
/-- Expanding `HasMixedAccuracy` gives the positivity assumptions on `ε` and `δ` together with the
defining inequality `(1 - δ) * hatf xBar ≤ hatf xStar + ε`. -/
