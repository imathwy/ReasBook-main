open scoped Gradient PositiveDefMatrixNorm SmoothConvex

variable {n : ℕ}

local notation "E" => EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)

/- Definition 7.39 lies in constrained smooth convex minimization on `ℝⁿ` with a weighted
Euclidean norm.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner for the
  primitive feasible-set and objective data;
- `ConvexC1SeminormSmooth` in `Chap02/Theorem_2_5`, the canonical owner for convex `C¹`
  objectives with a gradient-Lipschitz bound relative to a seminorm and its dual norm;
- `positiveDefMatrixNorm` in `Chap07/Definition_7_23`, the source-facing weighted seminorm
  attached to a positive-definite matrix;
- `Definition_3_64`, which keeps the feasible-set side on the ambient constrained owner rather
  than duplicating that data inside a second objective wrapper.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `CompositeSmoothConvexMinimizationProblem`;
- core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E` for `Q` and `φ`, together with
  `ConvexC1SeminormSmooth (positiveDefMatrixNorm G hG) L φ`;
- bridge/view: the notations `‖·‖[G]` and `‖·‖[G,*]` supplied by `positiveDefMatrixNorm`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set and objective, owned by `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E`;
- a positive-definite matrix `G`;
- a positive Lipschitz constant encoded canonically by `NNRealˣ`;
- nonemptiness, closedness, and convexity of the feasible set;
- the single smoothness owner witness for the objective.

Derived API:
- whole-space convexity of the objective;
- whole-space differentiability of the objective;
- the weighted dual-norm gradient-Lipschitz inequality.

The previous version stored the objective-side convexity, differentiability, and
gradient-Lipschitz properties as separate primitive fields. This refinement keeps the
source-facing problem structure, but moves the ambient problem data onto
`SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` and the smoothness package onto the canonical Chapter 2 owner
`ConvexC1SeminormSmooth`. -/

/-- Definition 7.39: a composite smooth convex minimization problem consists of a nonempty closed
convex feasible set `Q ⊆ ℝⁿ`, a convex differentiable objective `φ : ℝⁿ → ℝ`, a positive-definite
matrix `G` defining the weighted norm `‖·‖_G`, and a positive constant `L` such that
`‖∇φ(x) - ∇φ(y)‖*_G ≤ L ‖x - y‖_G` for all `x, y ∈ ℝⁿ`. The feasible-set and objective pair is
owned canonically by `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, and the objective-side smoothness data
is owned by `ConvexC1SeminormSmooth` for the weighted seminorm from Definition 7.23. -/
