universe u

/- Theorem 5.4.2.1 lies in the chapter's based-polar-set / finite-dimensional convex-geometry
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- project `polarSet`
- project `mem_polarSetAt_iff`
- mathlib `NormedSpace.isClosed_polar`
- mathlib `NormedSpace.isBounded_polar_of_mem_nhds_zero`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the compact-convex conclusion for the based polar body `polarSetAt Q xBar`
- core/canonical: the chapter owner `polarSet`
- bridge/view: the based displacement-set owner `polarSetAt`

Primitive data:
- a set `Q : Set E`
- a base point `xBar : E`
- for compactness and boundedness: `xBar ∈ interior Q`
- for the separate interior-nonemptiness companion: `Convex ℝ Q` together with the chapter
  no-affine-line hypothesis on `Q`

Derived API:
- unconditional closedness and convexity of `polarSetAt Q xBar`
- compactness and boundedness from the interior-point hypothesis
- nonempty interior under the extra source-facing convex/no-affine-line assumptions
- the trivial base-point-free fact `0 ∈ polarSetAt Q xBar`

This theorem file should not be tied to the display model `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`: the owner
`polarSetAt` already lives on real inner-product spaces, and the proof sketch only uses finite
dimensionality. The correct public surface is therefore a finite-dimensional real inner-product
space. The owner-level geometry also separates cleanly into two layers: `polarSetAt Q xBar` is
always an intersection of closed convex half-spaces, so its closedness and convexity are
unconditional, while compactness and boundedness use only the interior ball around `xBar`. The
chapter’s convexity and no-affine-line assumptions remain only on the separate interior-nonempty
companion theorem, where they belong.
