/- Definition 5.0.10 lies in the chapter's directional differential-calculus domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* mathlib `HasLineDerivAt`, the canonical owner for first directional derivatives along affine
  lines;
* mathlib `lineDeriv`, the totalized directional derivative operator corresponding to
  `t ↦ f (x + t • u)` at `t = 0`;
* mathlib `DifferentiableAt.lineDeriv_eq_fderiv` and `inner_gradient_left`, the primitive
  first-order bridge from directional derivatives to gradient pairings;
* `hessian` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the chapter owner for the second Fréchet derivative of
  a real-valued function on a Hilbert space;
* `iteratedFDeriv`, the canonical multilinear owner for the third Fréchet derivative.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the directional slice `t ↦ f (x + t • u)` and its first, second, and third
  derivatives at `0`;
* core/canonical: `lineDeriv ℝ f x u` for the first derivative and `hessian f x` for the
  second-order quadratic form;
* bridge/view: the identification of the third directional derivative with
  `iteratedFDeriv ℝ 3 f x (fun _ ↦ u)` under `C³` regularity.

Primitive data:
* a function `f`;
* a base point `x`;
* a direction `u`.

Derived API:
* the source-facing slice `directionalSlice f x u`;
* the owner-level first directional derivative `lineDeriv ℝ f x u`;
* the Hessian quadratic form `inner ℝ u (hessian f x u)`;
* the Fréchet third-derivative bridge for smooth functions.

The slice itself remains source-facing, but the first- and second-order derived API should reuse
the canonical owners `lineDeriv` and `hessian` instead of repeating their raw formulas. -/
