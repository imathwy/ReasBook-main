/- Proposition 5.0.30 lies in the chapter's Fenchel-conjugacy / third-order differential-calculus
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `fenchelDual` / notation `f⋆` in `Definition_5_0_27`, the chapter owner for the Fenchel dual;
* `dom` and `extendedRealRealPart` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_1_3`, the canonical finite-value
  domain / finite-real-part owners for `EReal`-valued functions;
* `IsMaxOn`, the canonical maximizer predicate for the Fenchel support functional
  `y ↦ ⟪s, y⟫ - f y` on `dom f`;
* `gradient` / notation `∇`, the canonical first-order owner for the branch equation
  `∇ f (xStar s) = s`;
* `hessian` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the intrinsic second-order owner;
* `fderiv ℝ (hessian g) x h` in `Definition_5_0_8`, the chapter owner for third derivatives;
* `fenchelConjugate_hessian_eq_inverse` in `Proposition_5_0_29`, the chapter owner for the
  preceding inverse-Hessian identity on `dom (f⋆)`;
* `exists_continuousLinearEquiv_fderiv_symm_eq` in mathlib, the canonical local-inverse
  differentiability bridge for genuine invertible Fréchet derivatives.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the third-derivative formula for `extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)` along a chosen
  Fenchel-maximizer branch `xStar : E → E` on `dom (f⋆)`;
* core/canonical: `extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)`, `hessian`, `∇`, and `IsMaxOn`;
* bridge/view: the prior identity
  `hessian (extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)) s = (hessian (withTopRealPart f) (xStar s)).inverse`.

Primitive data:
* the primal `WithTop ℝ`-valued function `f`;
* a branch `xStar : E → E` on `dom (f⋆)`;
* the source-facing facts that `xStar s` is the Fenchel-support maximizer at `s`,
  lies in `interior (dom f)`, and obeys the inverse-Hessian identity
  `hessian (extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)) s = (hessian (withTopRealPart f) (xStar s)).inverse`.

Derived API:
* the branch derivative identity
  `HasFDerivAt xStar (hessian (extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)) s) s`, exposed as the public bridge
  theorem `fenchelConjugate_maximizerBranch_hasFDerivAt`; in Lean the needed branch regularity is
  made explicit by assuming the chosen maximizer branch is continuous and locally right-inverts
  the primal gradient near each dual-domain slope;
* the third-derivative formula for `extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)` under the source hypotheses.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the branchwise `D³ f_*` formula on `dom (f⋆)`;
* core/canonical: the dual Hessian owner `hessian (extendedRealRealPart (f⋆))`;
* bridge/view: the reusable inverse-Hessian identity supplied separately by
  `fenchelConjugate_hessian_eq_inverse`, together with the branch-differentiability bridge theorem
  `fenchelConjugate_maximizerBranch_hasFDerivAt`.

The previous version strengthened the source statement by trying to derive the inverse-Hessian
identity from Proposition 5.0.29-style hypotheses instead of taking that identity as a primitive
assumption. This repair keeps the chosen branch `xStar` source-facing, restores the textbook
premise that the dual Hessian is already identified with the inverse primal Hessian on
`dom (f⋆)`, and leaves the stronger local tangent/branch-derivative package in the companion
within-domain and open-domain helper theorems used to prove the ambient `fderiv` formula. -/

section

-- Proof sketch: keep the auxiliary branch-differentiability bridge theorem separate, but state
-- Proposition 5.0.30 itself with the source assumptions that `xStar` is a maximizing branch and
-- already obeys the inverse-Hessian identity on `dom (f⋆)`.
-- The third-derivative formula is then the formal derivative of that assumed identity along the
-- branch.

source first-order stationarity equation `∇ f (xStar s) = s`. -/

/-- Proposition 5.0.30: let `xStar : E → E` be a chosen Fenchel-support maximizer branch on
`dom (f⋆)`. Assume `f` is three times differentiable on `interior (dom f)`, that
`xStar s ∈ interior (dom f)` and `xStar s` maximizes `y ↦ ⟪s, y⟫ - f y` on `dom f` for every
`s ∈ dom (f⋆)`, that the source stationarity equation `∇ (withTopRealPart f) (xStar s) = s`
holds on `dom (f⋆)`, and that the source inverse-Hessian identity (5.u341) is represented in
Lean by
`hessian (extendedRealRealPart (f⋆)) s = (hessian (withTopRealPart f) (xStar s)).inverse`.
Because `ContinuousLinearMap.inverse` is totalized in Lean, we also record the genuine
primal-Hessian invertibility needed to express the source inverse-Hessian hypothesis faithfully.
Because Lean's differential operators are totalized, the source-facing `D³ f⋆` identity is stated
here in the within-domain form closest to the textbook meaning; the stronger ambient `fderiv`
consequence on an open dual domain remains available as the companion theorem
`fenchelConjugate_hessianDerivative_formula_of_isOpen`. -/
