/- Theorem 5.1.2 lies in the Chapter 5 self-concordance affine-pullback calculus.

Primary domain:
- self-concordant functions on open convex domains and affine precomposition

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- `IsSelfConcordantOnWith`
- `ConvexC1On.comp_continuousAffineMap`
- `ClosedConvexOn.comp_continuousAffineMap`
- mathlib `HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn.comp_continuousAffineMap`

Best owner abstraction:
- `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.comp_continuousAffineMap`

Primitive data:
- the owner witness `hf : IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom Mf f`
- the continuous affine map `g : E →ᴬ[ℝ] E₁`

Derived API:
- the finite-dimensional affine-map specialization `comp_affineMap`
- the linear-plus-translation source presentation `x ↦ A x + b`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: affine pullback closure of self-concordance
- core/canonical: `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.comp_continuousAffineMap`
- bridge/view: finite-dimensional affine maps, then the textbook `A x + b` presentation

The old statement used a plain `LinearMap` together with finite-dimensional hypotheses only to
recover continuity. The canonical owner surface is the continuous-affine-map pullback theorem;
finite-dimensional affine-map presentations should be derived from it rather than kept as the main
API. -/

-- Proof sketch: openness and convexity pull back along a continuous affine map, `ContDiffOn`
-- composes with continuous affine maps, and the affine bridge identities for the Hessian local
-- norm and third directional derivative transfer the cubic bound with the same constant `Mf`.
/-- Theorem 5.1.2: precomposing a self-concordant function with a continuous affine map preserves
self-concordance on the affine preimage with the same self-concordance constant. This is the
canonical owner-level affine-pullback theorem. -/
