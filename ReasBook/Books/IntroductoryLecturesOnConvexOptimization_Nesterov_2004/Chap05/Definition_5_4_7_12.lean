/- Definition 5.4.7.12 lies in the Chapter 5 log-sum-exp epigraph / lifted exponential-cone
domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `exponentialCone` from `Definition_5_4_7_10`, the Chapter 5 source-facing scalar cone owner;
* `mem_exponentialCone_iff` from `Definition_5_4_7_10`, the scalar membership bridge for that
  owner;
* `logSumExpEpigraphCone` from `Definition_5_4_7_11`, the unlifted conic log-sum-exp epigraph
  owner on the same finite index family, obtained after forgetting the slack coordinates
  `y`.
* `mem_logSumExpEpigraphCone_iff` from `Definition_5_4_7_11`, the canonical owner-level
  membership bridge on that same finite-family ambient space.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `liftedConeLogSumExp`, the lifted cone `hat Q`;
* core/canonical: the earlier scalar owner `exponentialCone`;
* bridge/view: the coordinate map `i ↦ ((x i - t, y i), τ)` together with the normalization
  equation `∑ i, y i = τ`.

Primitive data:
* coordinatewise membership in the scalar exponential cone;
* the normalization equation `∑ i, y i = τ`.

Derived API:
* the membership bridge `mem_liftedConeLogSumExp_iff`, which keeps the lifted cone expressed
  through the scalar cone owner rather than re-expanding to raw inequalities;
* the owner-to-owner bridge `mem_logSumExpEpigraphCone_of_mem_liftedConeLogSumExp`, sending a
  lifted feasible point to the corresponding point of the canonical conic epigraph owner
  `logSumExpEpigraphCone`.

This refinement removes the recall-only surface and restores Definition 5.4.7.12 as the owner
file for the lifted log-sum-exp cone. The public definition now grows from the earlier
source-facing owner `exponentialCone`, exactly as the analogous lifted `ℓ_p` file grows from
`powerCone`, instead of bypassing the chapter owner with a raw coordinate inequality set. The
ambient family is now parameterized by an arbitrary finite index type `ι`, matching the upstream
owner `logSumExpEpigraphCone`; the textbook coordinate model `Fin n` is recovered by
specialization, and the nonempty-family hypothesis is only used where the projection theorem needs
one coordinate to read off the positivity of `τ`.

/-- Definition 5.4.7.12: the lifted cone `hat Q` for the log-sum-exp epigraph consists of the
quadruples `(x, y, t, τ)` such that each coordinate triple `((x^(i) - t, y^(i)), τ)` lies in the
scalar exponential cone and the slack variables satisfy the normalization equation
`∑ i, y^(i) = τ`. -/
