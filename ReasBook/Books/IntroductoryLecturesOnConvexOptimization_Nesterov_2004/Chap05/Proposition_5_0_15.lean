/- Proposition 5.0.15 lies in the Chapter 5 self-concordance / Hessian-comparison domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith` in `Definition_5_1_1`, the quantitative source-facing owner for
  self-concordance on a domain;
* `hessian` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the canonical second-order operator owner;
* `hessianLocalNorm` and the notation `‖u‖[f; x]` in `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for
  the local Hessian norm;
* `openDikinEllipsoid` together with the notation `W⁰[f; x](r)` in `Definition_5_0_13`, the
  source-facing owner for the Dikin-radius hypothesis.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the pointwise Hessian comparison between `x` and `y` under the textbook
  open-Dikin hypothesis;
* core/canonical: `IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom Mf f`, `hessian f z`, and `W⁰[f; x](r)`;
* bridge/view: the local-norm inequality encoded by membership in `W⁰[f; x](r)`.

Primitive data:
* a domain `dom`, a self-concordance constant `Mf`, and a function `f`;
* points `x y : E` and a radius `r`;
* the owner hypothesis `hself : IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom Mf f`;
* the source-facing inputs `hx : x ∈ dom`, `hy : y ∈ dom`, `hr : r < 1 / (Mf : ℝ)`, and
  `hxy : y ∈ W⁰[f; x](r)`, where `(hy, hxy)` together encode the textbook membership
  `y ∈ W(x; r) = {z ∈ dom f : ‖z - x‖_x < r}`.

Derived API:
* the lower and upper Loewner-order bounds comparing `hessian f x` and `hessian f y`.

The theorem should therefore stay directly on the bundled self-concordance owner and the canonical
Hessian owner, while exposing the exact-local-radius comparison as the reusable owner-level API and
carrying the domain-membership half of the textbook Dikin condition explicitly because the raw
owner `W⁰[f; x](r)` only records the local-norm inequality. -/

-- Proof sketch: for a fixed direction `v`, apply the one-dimensional self-concordance estimate
-- along the segment from `x` to `y` to the univariate function obtained by restricting the
-- Hessian quadratic form in the direction `v`. The Dikin-radius bound
-- `hessianLocalNorm f x (y - x) < r < 1 / M_f` then yields the factor `(1 - M_f r)^2` and its
-- reciprocal uniformly in `v`, which is exactly the Loewner-order comparison of the intrinsic
-- Hessian operators at `x` and `y`. The source-side Dikin ellipsoid membership
-- `y ∈ W(x; r) = {z ∈ dom f : ‖z - x‖_x < r}` is rendered here by the pair of hypotheses
-- `hy : y ∈ dom` and `hxy : y ∈ W⁰[f; x](r)`.
/-- Proposition 5.0.15: if `f` is self-concordant on `dom` with parameter `M_f`, `x ∈ dom`,
`y ∈ dom f`, `r < 1 / M_f`, and `‖y - x‖_x < r` (encoded here as `hxy : y ∈ W⁰[f; x](r)`), then
the Hessians at `x` and `y` are comparable in Loewner order by the factors `(1 - M_f r)^2` and
`(1 - M_f r)⁻²`. The explicit hypothesis `hy : y ∈ dom` supplies the domain-membership half of
the textbook Dikin ellipsoid condition `y ∈ W(x; r)`. -/
