Definition 5.0.3 lies in the unconstrained twice-differentiable minimization domain on complete
real inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner declarations:
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner for the
  primitive feasible-set/objective data of an ambient real-valued minimization problem;
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.toFunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem` in
  `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the canonical bridge from a set-constrained problem to the generic
  functional-constraint owner with zero scalar constraints;
- `FunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem.IsConstrained` and
  `FunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem.not_isConstrained_iff_feasibleSet_eq_univ` in
  `Chap01/Definition_1_1_4_1`, the generic owner predicate and whole-space bridge for
  constrainedness;
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.unconstrainedSmooth_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_3`, the
  earlier chapter pattern of keeping unconstrainedness on the owner surface and whole-space
  equalities as companion bridge API.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing/core:
  `¬ problem.toFunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem.IsConstrained ∧
    Differentiable ℝ problem.objective ∧
    Differentiable ℝ (∇ problem.objective)`;
- bridge/view:
  `problem.feasibleSet = Set.univ ∧
    Differentiable ℝ problem.objective ∧
    Differentiable ℝ (∇ problem.objective)`.

Primitive data:
- `problem.feasibleSet`
- `problem.objective`

Derived API:
- the generic-owner unconstrained-and-twice-differentiable expression above;
- the whole-space reformulation `twiceDifferentiableUnconstrained_iff`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the unconstrained twice-differentiable minimization problem;
- core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem E` together with the zero-constraint bridge
  owner `problem.toFunctionalConstraintsMinimizationProblem.IsConstrained` and the regularity
  layer `Differentiable ℝ problem.objective ∧ Differentiable ℝ (∇ problem.objective)`;
- bridge/view: the reformulation `problem.feasibleSet = Set.univ`.

Definition 5.0.3 does not need a Euclidean coordinate model: the source notion is intrinsic to the
ambient real Hilbert space. The public core therefore lives on `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem
E`, while the whole-space formulation is kept only as a companion bridge theorem.
