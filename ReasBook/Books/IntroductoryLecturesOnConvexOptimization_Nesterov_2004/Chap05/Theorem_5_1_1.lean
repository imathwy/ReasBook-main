/- Theorem 5.1.1 lies in the Chapter 5 self-concordance calculus domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for self-concordance on an
  open convex domain;
* mathlib `ContDiffOn.add` and `ConvexOn.add`, the canonical additive calculus owners reused by
  self-concordance proofs;
* `quadraticAffineObjective_isSelfConcordantOnWith_zero` from `Example_5_1_2`, the canonical
  zero-self-concordance perturbation owner used downstream in Corollary 5.1.2;
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.comp_continuousAffineMap` from `Theorem_5_1_2`, the nearby owner-level
  closure theorem showing the same namespace pattern for derived self-concordance calculus.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the weighted-sum closure theorem for self-concordant functions;
* core/canonical: the owner predicate `IsSelfConcordantOnWith`;
* bridge/view: the unweighted additive specialization `add`.

Primitive data:
* two owner witnesses `h₁ : IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom₁ M₁ f₁` and
  `h₂ : IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom₂ M₂ f₂`;
* positive weights `α` and `β`, carried canonically by `NNRealˣ`.

Derived API:
* the weighted-sum closure theorem itself;
* the additive specialization obtained by setting `α = β = 1`.

The refined file keeps the source-facing weighted theorem as the primary declaration and treats the
plain sum as its thin specialization, rather than as a second independent calculus theorem. -/
