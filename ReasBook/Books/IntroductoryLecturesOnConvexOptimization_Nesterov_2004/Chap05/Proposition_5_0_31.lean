Proposition 5.0.31 lies in the Chapter 5 self-concordance / Dikin-ellipsoid domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `openDikinEllipsoid` and the notation `W⁰[f; x](r)` in `Definition_5_0_13`, the chapter owner
  and textbook surface for the local quadratic neighborhood;
* `mem_openDikinEllipsoid_inv_constant_iff_hessian_quadratic_lt_inv_sq` in
  `Definition_5_0_14`, the source-facing inverse-parameter quadratic bridge;
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.openDikinEllipsoid_inv_constant_subset` in `Theorem_5_1_5`, the
  canonical owner-level domain-inclusion theorem;
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.hessian_posSemidef` in `Definition_5_1_1`, which supplies the
  nonnegativity needed by the quadratic bridge.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook inverse-Hessian quadratic neighborhood centered at `sBar`,
  together with the degenerate-point corollary at `0`;
* core/canonical: `W⁰[f; sBar](1 / (Mf : ℝ))` and
  `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.openDikinEllipsoid_inv_constant_subset`;
* bridge/view: the quadratic membership reformulation from `Definition_5_0_14`.

Primitive data:
* a domain `dom`, a self-concordance constant `Mf`, a function `f`, and a center `sBar`;
* the bundled owner hypothesis `IsSelfConcordantOnWith dom Mf f`;
* the displayed inverse-square Hessian quadratic inequality.

Derived API:
* the canonical Dikin neighborhood `W⁰[f; sBar](1 / (Mf : ℝ))`;
* the inverse-square quadratic reformulation of that neighborhood;
* the domain-membership conclusion.

This file therefore recalls the canonical Dikin-owner inclusion theorem directly and keeps only
the genuine quadratic-inequality bridge as new source-facing API. -/

/- Proposition 5.0.31 uses the canonical Dikin-owner inclusion theorem
`IsSelfConcordantOnWith.openDikinEllipsoid_inv_constant_subset` for the neighborhood
`W⁰[f; sBar](1 / (Mf : ℝ))`. -/
recall IsSelfConcordantOnWith.openDikinEllipsoid_inv_constant_subset

-- Proof sketch: rewrite the displayed quadratic bound as membership of `s` in the canonical
-- Dikin ellipsoid `W⁰[f; s̄](1 / M_f)` via the inverse-parameter quadratic bridge from
-- `Definition_5_0_14`, then apply the owner-level inclusion theorem
-- `IsSelfConcordantOnWith.openDikinEllipsoid_inv_constant_subset`. When `Mf = 0`, the bridge
-- identifies the displayed neighborhood with the empty Dikin ellipsoid, so the inclusion remains
-- vacuous without an extra positivity binder.
/-- Proposition 5.0.31: for a self-concordant function on an open convex domain `dom`, the
quadratic neighborhood `{s | ⟪s - s̄, ∇²f(s̄) (s - s̄)⟫ < 1 / M_f^2}` centered at `s̄ ∈ dom` is
contained in `dom`. Via Definition 5.0.14, this is the source-facing quadratic reformulation of
the canonical Dikin neighborhood `W⁰[f; sBar](1 / (Mf : ℝ))`. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply `selfConcordant_quadratic_neighborhood_subset_domain` to the point `0`.
-- The displayed hypothesis is exactly the same quadratic inequality after simplifying
-- `0 - s̄ = -s̄` and the Hessian quadratic form in the displacement vector.
/-- If the Hessian quadratic form of the displacement from `s̄` to the origin is less than
`1 / M_f^2`, then the origin belongs to the domain. -/
