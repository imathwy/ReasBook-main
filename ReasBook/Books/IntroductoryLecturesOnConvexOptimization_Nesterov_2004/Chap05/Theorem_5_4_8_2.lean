noncomputable section

/- Theorem 5.4.8.2 lies in the chapter's logarithmic-barrier / epigraph-lifting domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `negLog_isSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith_nonnegativeRay` in `Example_5_3_1_3`, the scalar owner
  for the base barrier `x ↦ -log x`;
* `epigraphLogBarrier_isSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` in `Theorem_5_3_5`, the chapter owner for
  lifting a barrier to the strict epigraph on the canonical `WithLp 2 (E × ℝ)` product;
* mathlib `WithLp 2 (ℝ × ℝ)` together with `WithLp.ofLp`, the canonical `L²` ambient owner and
  the public bridge back to the textbook raw pairs;
* `constrainedEpigraph` and `mem_constrainedEpigraph_iff` in `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the
  chapter owner for the closed epigraph from Definition 5.4.8.5;
* `strictConstrainedEpigraph` and `epigraphLogBarrier` in `Theorem_5_3_5`, the source-facing
  strict-epigraph and lifted-barrier owners reused by the specialization below.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the interior of the closed epigraph from Definition 5.4.8.5;
* core/canonical: the lifted barrier owner
  `epigraphLogBarrier_isSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith`;
* bridge/view: the interior-identification theorem below, which rewrites the closed epigraph
  interior as the corresponding strict epigraph.

Primitive data:
* the base logarithmic barrier `x ↦ -Real.log x`;
* the closed epigraph owner
  `constrainedEpigraph (Set.Ioi (0 : ℝ)) (fun x : ℝ ↦ (-Real.log x : WithTop ℝ))`.

Derived API:
* the source-facing interior membership theorem;
* the specialized lifted barrier statement for the canonical epigraph logarithmic barrier.

The file therefore keeps the source-facing interior statement, but the barrier theorem is intended
to be a thin specialization of the chapter owners for the scalar `-log` barrier and epigraph
lifting, rather than a second local barrier construction. -/

-- Proof sketch: first rewrite the interior of the canonical closed epigraph from

-- `negLog_isSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith_nonnegativeRay` and the canonical epigraph-lifting owner
