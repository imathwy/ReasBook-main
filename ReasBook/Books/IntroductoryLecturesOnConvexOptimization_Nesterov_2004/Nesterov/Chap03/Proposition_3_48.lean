open scoped ConstrainedArgmin

/- Proposition 3.48 lies in the chapter's constrained minimization / explicit argmin domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `constrainedArgmin` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the chapter
  owner for minimizers of an objective over a feasible set;
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the later package owner built
  from a feasible set and an objective;
- `IsMinOn` and `isMinOn_iff` in mathlib, the canonical pointwise minimizer predicate on a set.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the explicit Kelley complete-data objective `f(y, x) = max {|y|, ‖x‖²}` and
  feasible set `Q = {(y, x) | y² + ‖x‖² ≤ 1}`;
- core/canonical: the minimizer owner `argmin[Q] f`, with `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` as the
  atomic membership view;
- bridge/view: the later problem package
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.mk kelleyCompleteFeasibleSet kelleyCompleteObjective`.

Primitive data:
- the explicit objective `kelleyCompleteObjective`;
- the explicit feasible set `kelleyCompleteFeasibleSet`.

Derived API:
- feasibility and objective-value simplification at the origin;
- the argmin set equality and its atomic membership corollary.

This proposition is therefore kept source-facing on the explicit `f` and `Q`, while exposing its
optimality result through the canonical constrained-argmin owner rather than through any extra
wrapper around the same minimizer set.

/-- Proposition 3.48: for the problem
`min {f(y, x) | (y, x) ∈ Q}` with
`f(y, x) = max {|y|, ‖x‖²}` and `Q = {(y, x) | y² + ‖x‖² ≤ 1}`,
the unique optimal solution is the origin, i.e. the minimizer set is `{(0, 0)}`. Specializing
`X = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` recovers the textbook `ℝ × ℝⁿ` instance. -/
-- Proof sketch: first show every feasible point has nonnegative objective value, while the origin
-- is feasible and attains value `0`. Hence the origin is a minimizer. If another feasible point
-- were also minimizing, its objective value would be `0`, forcing both `|y| = 0` and `‖x‖² = 0`,
-- so `y = 0` and `x = 0`.
