/- Definition 3.1.5.4 lives in the chapter's extended-valued convex-analysis domain.

Primary domain:
- convex analysis of extended-real-valued functions on real inner product spaces.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `IsSubgradientAt`
- `subdifferential`
- `mem_subdifferential_iff`
- `constrainedSubdifferential`

Best owner abstraction:
- the pointwise owner `subdifferential` from `Definition_3_1_5`

Primitive data reused from upstream owners:
- the pointwise subdifferentials `subdifferential f x`
- the indexing set `X`

Derived API introduced here:
- `commonRegularSubdifferential`
- the textbook surface notation `∂̂ f(X)`
- `mem_commonRegularSubdifferential_iff`
- the real-valued bridge/view `commonRegularSubdifferentialOn`
- `mem_commonRegularSubdifferentialOn_iff`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the common regular subdifferential `commonRegularSubdifferential f X`
- core/canonical: the pointwise owner `subdifferential`
- bridge/view: `mem_commonRegularSubdifferential_iff` and
  `commonRegularSubdifferentialOn`

The textbook states the notion on `ℝⁿ`, but this construction depends only on the ambient real
inner-product-space structure already used by the upstream subdifferential owner. This file
therefore keeps the same mathematical meaning while matching that owner ambient generality, so
Euclidean downstream uses specialize directly without a second local wrapper layer. -/

variable {V : Type u} [SeminormedAddCommGroup V] [InnerProductSpace ℝ V]

/-- Bridge/view: the common regular subdifferential of a real-valued function on `X` is the
common regular subdifferential of its canonical `WithTop ℝ` lift. Public theorem surfaces for
real-valued objectives can therefore use the textbook notation `∂̂ f(X)` directly. -/

textbook spelling `∂̂ f(X)` as the upstream `WithTop` owner. -/
