/- Proposition 3.24 lies in the chapter's constrained-subdifferential / feasible-set convexity
domain.

Mandatory domain-style sampling before refinement:
- `dom` and `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter owners for the effective domain and
  finite real part of an extended-real-valued function;
- `constrainedSubdifferential` together with the notation `∂[Q] f(x)` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the
  feasible-set owner for subgradients on a constrained domain;
- `convexOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty` and
  `lowerSemicontinuousOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty` in `Corollary_3_1_8`, the
  chapter owners for the convexity and lower-semicontinuity consequences on a feasible set.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing main conclusion: convexity and lower semicontinuity of `withTopRealPart f` on
  `Q₁`;
- core/canonical owners: `dom f`, `∂[Q₁] f(x)`, `ConvexOn`, and `LowerSemicontinuousOn`;
- bridge/view: the feasible-set parameter `Q₁`, together with the ambient extension recording
  `dom f ⊆ Q₁`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q₁`;
- the extended-real-valued ambient extension `f`;
- the convexity of the feasible set `Q₁`;
- the properness hypothesis `(dom f).Nonempty`;
- the source-faithful domain inclusion `dom f ⊆ Q₁`;
- the owner-level constrained-subdifferential data on `Q₁`.

Derived API:
- convexity and lower semicontinuity of `withTopRealPart f` on `Q₁`;
- the source-facing bridge from a convex-hull presentation
  `∂[Q₁] f(x) = convexHull ℝ (Y x)` with `Y x` nonempty on `Q₁`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: a proper function on `Q₁`;
- core/canonical: the constrained subdifferential `∂[Q₁] f(x)` on the feasible set `Q₁` and the
  two owner consequences on `withTopRealPart f`;
- bridge/view: encoding a function on `Q₁` by an ambient `WithTop ℝ`-valued function whose
  effective domain lies in `Q₁`.

Semantic search note: `lean_leansearch` did not surface the chapter-local constrained-subgradient
corollary directly, so the owner choice here is fixed by the local APIs
`constrainedSubdifferential`,
`convexOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty`, and
`lowerSemicontinuousOn_of_constrainedSubdifferential_nonempty`.
