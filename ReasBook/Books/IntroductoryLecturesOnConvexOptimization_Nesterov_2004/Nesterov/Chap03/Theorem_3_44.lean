/- Theorem 3.44 lies in the chapter's constrained strong-convexity / relative-subdifferential
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `constrainedSubdifferential` and `mem_constrainedSubdifferential_iff` in `Definition_3_1_5`
- mathlib `StrongConvexOn`
- the Chapter 3 owner recall `StrongConvexOn Q μ f` in `Definition_3_2_2`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the constrained-subdifferential notation `∂[Q] f(x)` for real-valued objectives
- core/canonical: `constrainedSubdifferential`
- bridge/view: the codomain-coercion view `subdifferentialWithin Q f x`

Primitive data:
- the constrained `WithTop`-valued subdifferential owner
- a real-valued objective `f`

Derived API:
- `subdifferentialWithin`
- `mem_subdifferentialWithin_iff`
- `StrongConvexOn.lower_bound_of_mem_subdifferentialWithin`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Theorem 3.44's quadratic affine lower bound for real-valued strongly convex
  functions, written on `g ∈ ∂[Q] f(x)`
- core/canonical: `constrainedSubdifferential` and `StrongConvexOn`
- bridge/view: `subdifferentialWithin`, the real-valued view of the constrained owner

This file therefore keeps the source-facing notation `∂[Q] f(x)` on its main theorem surfaces and
uses `subdifferentialWithin` only as the thin real-valued bridge/view, instead of duplicating a
second primitive subgradient predicate. The bridge/view itself only needs the same seminormed
inner-product ambient layer as `Definition_3_1_5`; the stronger normed ambient structure is
required only for the quadratic strong-convexity lower bound. -/

/-- Theorem 3.44: if `f` is `μ`-strongly convex on `Q`, then every feasible subgradient
`g ∈ ∂[Q] f(x)` gives the quadratic affine lower bound
`f y ≥ f x + ⟪g, y - x⟫ + (μ / 2) * ‖y - x‖^2` for every `y ∈ Q`. -/
-- Proof sketch: tilt `f` by the affine functional `z ↦ -⟪g, z⟫`. The subgradient hypothesis says
-- that `x` minimizes this tilted objective on `Q`, while strong convexity is preserved under
-- affine perturbations. The canonical owner theorem
-- `quadratic_growth_of_isMinOn_of_mem` applied to that tilted objective then yields the stated
-- lower bound after rearranging the affine term.
