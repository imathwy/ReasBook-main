namespace GeneralMinimizationProblem

variable {n m : ℕ}

/- Definition 3.72 lies in the constrained-optimization domain of source-facing data on
`GeneralMinimizationProblem n m`.

Primary mathematical domain:
* finitely constrained Lipschitz minimization and its single aggregate-constraint reformulation

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `problem.HasLeConstraints` and `problem.mem_feasibleSet_iff` in
  `Chap01/Definition_1_1_1`
* `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem` in
  `Chap01/Definition_1_10_21`
* `pointwiseSupremumOn` and
  `constraintInequalities_eq_aggregateConstraintSublevelSet` in
  `Chap03/Definition_3_42`

Best owner abstraction:
* `GeneralMinimizationProblem n m`, with the Chapter 1 bundled owner
  `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem` used only as derived API and the aggregate constraint
  reused from the Chapter 3 owner `pointwiseSupremumOn`

Primitive data:
* the owner problem `problem`
* nonemptiness, boundedness, closedness, and convexity of `problem.basicFeasibleSet`
* the inequality-sense hypothesis `problem.HasLeConstraints`
* global Lipschitz bounds for `problem.objective` and each scalar constraint

Derived API:
* the Chapter 1 owner predicate `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem`, recovered by deriving
  continuity from the primitive Lipschitz hypotheses
* the aggregate constraint `pointwiseSupremumOn (Set.univ : Set (Fin m))` applied to the coercion
  of `problem.constraints` into `WithTop ℝ`
* the feasible-set rewrite already owned upstream by
  `constraintInequalities_eq_aggregateConstraintSublevelSet`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Definition 3.72 as feasible-set geometry, inequality sense, and
  Lipschitz data on the owner problem, together with the aggregate constraint
  `f̄ = pointwiseSupremumOn (Set.univ : Set (Fin m))` applied to the coerced constraint family
* core/canonical: `GeneralMinimizationProblem n m` together with
  `problem.IsFunctionalConstraintProblem` and `pointwiseSupremumOn`
* bridge/view: `isFunctionalConstraintProblem_of_lipschitz`, which upgrades the source-facing
  hypothesis list to the canonical Chapter 1 owner predicate, and the rewrite of the finite
  constraint family as one aggregate inequality

Accordingly, this file keeps the main labeled entry at the source-facing primitive data,
derives the canonical functional-constraint package instead of introducing a parallel local
predicate, reuses the Chapter 3 owner for the aggregate constraint after the canonical
`ℝ → WithTop ℝ` coercion, and keeps only the owner-level bridge from `problem.feasibleSet` to
the aggregate-constraint sublevel set. -/

variable (problem : GeneralMinimizationProblem n m)

/-
Definition 3.72: a finitely constrained Lipschitz minimization problem on a nonempty bounded
closed convex set `Q ⊆ ℝⁿ` is exactly a general minimization problem whose basic feasible set `Q`
is nonempty bounded closed and convex, whose scalar constraints are all of the form `fⱼ(x) ≤ 0`,
and whose objective and constraint functions are globally Lipschitz on `Q`. The source spelling
uses `Fin m`; the aggregate-constraint reformulation below does not need any extra nonemptiness
hypothesis on that index type, because the owner theorem already handles the empty-index case. The
canonical Chapter 1 owner predicate is recovered separately by
`isFunctionalConstraintProblem_of_lipschitz`.
