Theorem 3.1.12 lies in the chapter's convex directional-derivative bridge domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `dom` and `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter owners for the effective domain and
  finite real representative of an `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function;
- `ConvexOn.comp_affineMap`, the canonical way to pass convexity to the one-variable directional
  slice;
- `ConvexOn.hasDerivWithinAt_sInf_slope_of_mem_interior` in mathlib
  `Analysis/Convex/Deriv.lean`, the owner theorem for one-sided derivatives of convex real-valued
  functions on an interval-like interior domain.

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical: the one-variable convex derivative theorem
  `ConvexOn.hasDerivWithinAt_sInf_slope_of_mem_interior` applied to the affine slice
  `α ↦ x + α • p`;
- bridge/view: the source-facing secant-slope limit statement below, together with eventual
  finiteness of the ray in `dom f`.

Primitive data:
- a convexity witness `hf : ConvexOn ℝ (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)`;
- an interior point `hx : x ∈ interior (dom f)`.

Derived API:
- eventual finiteness of `x + α • p` for `α ↓ 0`;
- convergence of the finite real secant slopes.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the secant-slope limit theorem below;
- core/canonical: the mathlib one-variable derivative theorem on the directional slice;
- bridge/view: the affine-line reduction from `E` to `ℝ`.

/-- Theorem 3 1 12: a convex `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function has a finite one-sided directional
derivative in every direction at every interior point of its effective domain. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply the monotonicity argument for the positive secant slopes
-- `α ↦ (withTopRealPart f (x + α • p) - withTopRealPart f x) / α` of a convex function. The
-- interior-point hypothesis gives a backward point on the same affine line, which yields a
-- uniform lower bound on these slopes; hence they admit a finite right limit in `ℝ`.
