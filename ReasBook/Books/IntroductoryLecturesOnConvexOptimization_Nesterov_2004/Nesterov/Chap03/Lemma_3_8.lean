/- Lemma 3.8 lies in the chapter's extended-valued convex-composition / subdifferential-calculus
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `withTopEffectiveDomain` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter owner for the finite-value domain
- `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the owner finite-value representative
- `ConvexOn.comp` in mathlib, the canonical monotone convex-composition owner on an image set
- `subdifferential` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the owner subgradient-set API

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `monotoneConvexComp`
- core/canonical ambient owners: `withTopEffectiveDomain`, `withTopRealPart`, `ConvexOn.comp`,
  `subdifferential`
- bridge/view: `monotoneConvexComp_apply_of_mem_effectiveDomain`

Primitive data:
- the source-facing composition `monotoneConvexComp φ ψ`

Derived API:
- `monotoneConvexComp_apply_of_mem_effectiveDomain`
- `monotoneConvexComp_convexOn`
- `subdifferential_monotoneConvexComp_eq_convexHull`

The previous file duplicated the chapter owners for effective domains, finite real parts,
convexity, and subdifferentials. Those notions already live upstream, so this file now keeps only
the composition-specific source-facing object and states its monotonicity and subdifferential
conclusions as two atomic theorems directly on the canonical image-set and pointwise-set-operation
surfaces. The convexity clause therefore lives at the weak module layer inherited from
`ConvexOn.comp`, while the subdifferential clause stays on the real inner-product-space layer
required by `∂`, rather than re-specializing either statement to Euclidean coordinates.
