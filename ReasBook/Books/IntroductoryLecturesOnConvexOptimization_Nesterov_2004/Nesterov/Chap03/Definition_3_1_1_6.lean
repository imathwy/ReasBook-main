-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 3.1.1.6 is a recall-only item in the seminorm-geometry domain.

Layer targeted by this refinement:
- source-facing recall of the core/canonical owner closed-ball API for seminorms

Primary domain:
- closed balls attached to seminorms.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Seminorm.closedBall`
- `Seminorm.mem_closedBall`
- `Seminorm.mem_closedBall_zero`
- `Seminorm.closedBall_zero_eq`

Primitive data:
- a seminorm `p : Seminorm ℝ E`
- a center `x₀ : E`
- a radius `r : ℝ`

Derived API:
- `Seminorm.mem_closedBall` gives the set-builder characterization
  `x ∈ p.closedBall x₀ r ↔ p (x - x₀) ≤ r`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook closed ball attached to a seminorm
- core/canonical: `Seminorm.closedBall`
- bridge/view: the defining membership lemma `Seminorm.mem_closedBall`

This file therefore keeps only the general owner declaration and its defining bridge view.
Downstream unit-ball files should use the same owner declaration directly and recall the zero-center
specializations there.
