Theorem 3.1.3.2 lies in the chapter's convex directional-differentiability domain.

Primary domain:
- finite one-sided directional differentiability of convex `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions at
  interior points of the effective domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `DirectionallyDifferentiableAt` and `HasDirectionalDerivAt` in
  `Nesterov.Chap03.Definition_3_1_3_1`, the source-facing directional-derivative owners;
- `dom f`, `withTopRealPart f`, and `withTopToEReal ∘ f` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter's
  canonical bridge from `WithTop ℝ`-valued convex functions to the `EReal` directional-derivative
  owner surface;
- `exists_tendsto_right_directionalSlope_of_convexOn_of_mem_interior_effectiveDomain` in
  `Nesterov.Chap03.Theorem_3_1_12`, the upstream finite-real secant-slope limit theorem that
  supplies the bridge data.

Best owner abstraction:
- `DirectionallyDifferentiableAt (withTopToEReal ∘ f) x p`

Primitive data:
- the convexity witness `hf : ConvexOn ℝ (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)`;
- the interior-point assumption `hx : x ∈ interior (dom f)`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing directional differentiability statement below;
- the explicit `∃ d, HasDirectionalDerivAt ... d` companion.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: directional differentiability of a convex `WithTop ℝ`-valued function at an
  interior point of `dom f`;
- core/canonical: `DirectionallyDifferentiableAt` and `HasDirectionalDerivAt`;
- bridge/view: the secant-slope existence theorem `Theorem_3_1_12`.

The previous version moved the numbered item to the weaker `EReal` secant-limit bridge layer by
recalling `Theorem_3_14`. This file now returns to the source-facing directional-derivative API,
uses `Theorem_3_1_12` only as internal bridge data, and keeps the ambient space at the weaker
topological real-module owner level already used by `HasDirectionalDerivAt`, rather than freezing
the older normed-space proof route into the public theorem surface.

/-- Theorem 3.1.3.2: a convex `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function is directionally differentiable in every
direction at every interior point of its effective domain. -/
-- Proof sketch: `Theorem_3_1_12` already yields a finite real right limit of the secant slopes
-- together with eventual finiteness of the ray. Interpreting that limit as a derivative of the
-- scalar slice gives `HasDirectionalDerivAt` for the canonical `EReal` bridge `withTopToEReal ∘
-- f`, and hence `DirectionallyDifferentiableAt`.
