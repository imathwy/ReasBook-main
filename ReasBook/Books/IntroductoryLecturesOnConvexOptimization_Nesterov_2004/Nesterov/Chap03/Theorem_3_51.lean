/- Primary domain: intrinsic volume comparison for convex subsets of a closed ball in a
finite-dimensional real normed space.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Convex.nullMeasurableSet`
- `MeasureTheory.measureReal_mono`
- `MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_real_closedBall`
- `Module.finrank_pos`

Owner abstraction:
- the ambient additive Haar measure owner `μ` together with its real-valued evaluation `μ.real`
  on an arbitrary finite-dimensional real normed space.

Layer of this file:
- `source-facing`. The theorem is the chapter's direct radius-volume comparison, while its owner
  layer is the intrinsic finite-dimensional real-space volume API rather than the coordinate model
  `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.

Primitive data:
- the convex set `Q`, the comparison set `Sk`, the center `xStar`, and the radii `D`, `vkStar`
- the positive-dimension hypothesis `0 < dim`
- convexity and outer-ball containment for `Q`
- positivity of `μ.real Q`
- the source-visible radius sign condition `0 < D`
- measurability of `Sk`
- the source-facing inclusion `Sk ⊆ Q`
- the inclusion `Metric.closedBall xStar vkStar ∩ Q ⊆ Sk`
- the chapter-context premise `xStar ∈ Q`

Derived API:
- positivity of `dim`, supplied directly by the public hypothesis
- finiteness of `Sk`, derived from `Sk ⊆ Q ⊆ Metric.closedBall xStar D`
- the real-valued bound on `vkStar` in terms of the measure ratio `μ.real Sk / μ.real Q`, with
  the exponent written canonically as `1 / dim`.

/-- Theorem 3.51, stated at the intrinsic owner level: if `0 < Module.finrank ℝ E`, if a convex
set `Q` of positive `μ`-volume in a finite-dimensional real normed space is contained in the
closed ball `B(xStar, D)` with `0 < D`, if `Sk ⊆ Q` is measurable, and if
`B(xStar, vkStar) ∩ Q ⊆ Sk`, then under the chapter's standing center context `xStar ∈ Q` and
the standing radius bound `vkStar ≤ D` coming from the earlier localization setup, the inner
radius `vkStar` is bounded by `D` times the `dim`-th root of the Haar-measure ratio
`μ.real Sk / μ.real Q`. The finite-volume side condition on `Sk` is derived internally from
`Sk ⊆ Q ⊆ B(xStar, D)`. Specializing to the canonical choice
`μ = Measure.addHaar` gives the chapter owner used downstream, and in Euclidean space this differs
from textbook Lebesgue volume only by a global positive normalization factor, so the displayed
ratio is unchanged.
-/
-- Proof sketch: the standing radius comparison gives `vkStar ≤ D`, so one can normalize
-- `α = vkStar / D ∈ [0, 1]`.
-- Since `xStar ∈ Q` and `Q` is convex, the homothetic copy `(1 - α) • xStar + α • Q` lies in
-- `Q`; because `Q ⊆ Metric.closedBall xStar D`, that same set also lies in
-- `Metric.closedBall xStar vkStar`. Hence it is contained in `Sk`. Taking volumes and using
-- translation invariance together with the scaling rule yields
-- `μ.real Sk ≥ α ^ dim * μ.real Q`, which rearranges to the claimed bound.
