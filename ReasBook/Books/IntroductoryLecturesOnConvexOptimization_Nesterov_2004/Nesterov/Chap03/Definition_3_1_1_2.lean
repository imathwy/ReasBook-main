/- Definition 3.1.1.2 is the source-facing owner of the finite-value domain of an
extended-real-valued function.

Primary domain:
- finite-value domains of `EReal`-valued functions.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- chapter `withTopEffectiveDomain` in `Definition_3_3`, the analogous owner for `WithTop ℝ`
- chapter `mem_withTopEffectiveDomain_iff` in `Definition_3_3`, the atomic membership bridge for
  that owner
- mathlib `EReal.canLift`, whose predicate is exactly "neither `⊤` nor `⊥`"
- mathlib `EReal.range_coe_eq_Ioo`, the canonical order-theoretic description of finite `EReal`
  values

Best owner abstraction:
- `extendedRealEffectiveDomain`

Primitive data:
- the pointwise finiteness predicate `f x ≠ ⊤ ∧ f x ≠ ⊥`

Derived API:
- `mem_extendedRealEffectiveDomain_iff`
- `extendedRealEffectiveDomain_nonempty_iff`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the effective domain of an extended-real-valued function
- core/canonical: `extendedRealEffectiveDomain`
- bridge/view: `mem_extendedRealEffectiveDomain_iff`

The textbook states this notion for functions on `ℝⁿ`, but the domain construction itself uses no
Euclidean structure. Following the chapter owner style from `Definition_3_3`, this file exposes
the canonical owner on an arbitrary domain type; later items simply specialize it. -/

/-- Definition 3.1.1.2: the chapter's effective-domain owner for an extended-real-valued
function, namely the set of points where the value is a finite real. The textbook then treats the
nonemptiness condition on this domain as a standing assumption. -/

/- The textbook immediately adds the standing assumption that the effective domain is nonempty.
The canonical Lean surface for that assumption is simply `(dom f).Nonempty`. -/
