/- Definition 3.18 is a source-facing item in the chapter's polar/support-function domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- project `supportFunction`
- project `supportFunction_apply`
- mathlib `StrongDual.polar`
- project `polarSetAt`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the chapter declaration `polarSet`
- core/canonical: the earlier chapter owner `supportFunction`

Primitive data:
- a set `Q : Set E` in a real inner-product space `E`

Derived API:
- the support-function sublevel presentation `ξ[Q] g ≤ 1`
- the inequality characterization `mem_polarSet_iff`
- the later based variant `polarSetAt`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook polar set of `Q`
- core/canonical: `supportFunction`
- bridge/view: the based variant `polarSetAt Q xBar`

The sampled mathlib polar lives in the strong dual and uses the absolute-value bound
`‖x' z‖ ≤ 1`, so it is not the exact source-facing owner for this one-sided Euclidean-pairing
notion. Within the chapter, however, the primitive construction already exists upstream as the
support function `ξ[Q]`. This file therefore keeps the source-facing owner `polarSet`, but defines
it through the canonical Chapter 3 owner `supportFunction` instead of storing the same family of
pairing inequalities as primitive data. As with nearby owner files such as `Definition_3_9`, the
source prose is Euclidean, but the declaration only needs the ambient real inner-product-space
structure used by the pairing.

/-- Definition 3.18, generalized from the textbook Euclidean setting: the polar set of
`Q` consists of the vectors whose pairing with every point of `Q` is at most `1`.
Specializing to `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` recovers the textbook `Qᵒ ⊆ ℝⁿ`. -/
