Corollary 1.9.7 is a source-facing consequence of the owner-side conjugate-gradient datum
`IsConjugateGradientSequence problem x0 xs`.

* primitive data: the quadratic problem `problem`, the initial point `x0`, the positive-indexed
  iterate sequence `xs`, the owner hypothesis `hcg`, and the stage `k`;
* owner abstraction: the canonical Krylov space `problem.krylovSubspace x0 k`;
* derived API: the owner-side orthogonality bridge
  `problem.gradient_mem_krylovSubspace_orthogonal_of_isMinOn_affineKrylovSearchSpace`.

Accordingly, the corollary is stated directly as an owner-side theorem on
`IsConjugateGradientSequence`, not as a parallel free-standing wrapper around the same data.

/-- Corollary 1.9.7: in the conjugate-gradient method for an unconstrained quadratic problem, the
gradient at the `k`th iterate lies in the orthogonal complement of the `k`th Krylov subspace
`𝓛ₖ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: `hcg.isMinOn_affineKrylovSearchSpace k` says that `xs k` minimizes the quadratic
-- objective on the owner affine space `x₀ + 𝓛ₖ`. First-order optimality on an affine subspace
-- therefore makes `∇ problem.objective (xs k)` orthogonal to every vector in the direction of
-- that affine space. Since the direction of `problem.affineKrylovSearchSpace x0 k` is exactly
-- `problem.krylovSubspace x0 k`, the gradient lies in `𝓛ₖᗮ`.
