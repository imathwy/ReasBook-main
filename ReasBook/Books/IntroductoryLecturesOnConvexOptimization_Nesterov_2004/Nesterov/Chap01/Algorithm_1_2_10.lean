/-- Algorithm 1.2.10: a general iterative scheme is organized around the accumulated informational
set `𝓘_k` of oracle samples. The current query point, the stopping criterion, and the output are
all chosen from that informational set; in particular, the initial point is `query ∅ = x₀`. This
uses the informational state owner from Definition 1.2.13 directly, rather than an auxiliary
ordered transcript. -/
