Domain design notes:

Primary domain:
* functions with Lipschitz-continuous Hessian on a real Hilbert space

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian` in `Chap04/Definition_4_2_7`
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian.contDiff`
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian.norm_sub_le`
* the theorem-surface notation `f ∈ C22[M]`

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the textbook class `C_M^{2,2}(ℝⁿ)`
* core/canonical: `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian M f`
* bridge/view: the theorem-surface notation `f ∈ C22[M]`, the `C²` projection
  `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian.contDiff`, and the Hessian-difference estimate
  `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian.norm_sub_le`

Primitive data:
* none; this is a recall-only item

Derived API:
* the owner predicate `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian M f`
* the notation `f ∈ C22[M]`
* the `C²` regularity projection
* the operator-norm Hessian estimate

This item is a pure recall of the chapter owner, not a place to introduce a parallel local
wrapper. The textbook `ℝⁿ` statement is the specialization
`E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. -/

section

variable {M : NNReal} {f : E → ℝ}

/- Definition 1.5.3: the textbook class `C_M^{2,2}(ℝⁿ)` is represented in this project by the
canonical owner `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian M f`, written on theorem surfaces as `f ∈ C22[M]`.
Its defining consequences are the inherited `C²` regularity and the displayed Hessian Lipschitz
estimate `‖∇² f(x) - ∇² f(y)‖ ≤ M ‖x - y‖`. -/
