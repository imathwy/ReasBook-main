Assumption 4.4.2 lies in the order/topological sublevel-set domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `Definition_1_4_8`, which already owns the level-set notation `𝓛[f](τ)` together with the
  atomic companions `mem_levelSet_iff` and `levelSet_eq_setOf`
* `Definition_4_1_1`, the Chapter 4 recall of that same owner surface
* mathlib `Set.Iic`, the canonical lower interval whose preimage defines `𝓛[f](τ)`
* `HasUniformDualNondegeneracyOnInitialSublevelSet` in `Assumption_4_4_3`, the nearby Chapter 4
  source-facing owner that specializes the same sublevel-set surface to the modified
  Gauss--Newton merit function

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `IsSufficientlyLargeFeasibleSetAt f 𝓕 x₀`
* core/canonical: `x₀ ∈ interior 𝓕 ∧ 𝓛[f]((f x₀)) ⊆ 𝓕`
* bridge/view: `levelSet_eq_setOf f (f x₀)`

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `𝓕`
* the base point `x₀`
* the preorder-valued objective `f : E → α`
* the interior condition `x₀ ∈ interior 𝓕`
* containment of the canonical initial sublevel set `𝓛[f]((f x₀))` in `𝓕`

Derived API:
* the interior-membership projection
* the owner-level sublevel-set inclusion
* the whole-space specialization, where the assumption is automatic

There is no upstream owner for the full conjunction in this assumption, so the source-facing
predicate stays. The duplicate wheel was the raw set-builder encoding of the sublevel set, which
is refined here to the existing chapter owner notation.

objective `f` when `x₀ ∈ interior 𝓕` and the canonical sublevel set `𝓛[f]((f x₀))` is contained
