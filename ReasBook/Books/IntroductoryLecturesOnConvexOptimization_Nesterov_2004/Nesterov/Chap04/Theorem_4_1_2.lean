/- Theorem 4.1.2 splits into a proper-space asymptotic layer and a local-optimality layer whose
first-order owner is intrinsic, while the source-facing second-order consequence is still
expressed in the Euclidean Hessian-matrix view.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `CubicRegularizationMethod` in `Algorithm_4_1_5`, the chapter owner for the trajectory;
* the canonical sublevel-set owner `𝓛[f](α)`, recalled in `Definition_4_1_1`;
* `HessianLipschitzOn` in `Definition_4_1_2`, the chapter owner for the open-convex `C²`
  Hessian-Lipschitz region;
* `cubicRegularizationLocalOptimalityMeasure` in `Definition_4_1_4`, already used downstream
  through the textbook surface `μ[M](x)` when `f` and `L` are ambient;
* `cubicRegularization_localOptimalityMeasure_tendsto_zero` in `Theorem_4_1_1`, the chapter
  owner theorem for `μ[L](xᵢ) → 0` along the cubic-regularization trajectory;
* `MapClusterPt.exists_seq_tendsto` from mathlib, the canonical bridge from cluster points to
  convergent subsequences.

Best owner abstractions:
* source-facing: the convergence and cluster-point consequences for a
  `CubicRegularizationMethod`;
* core/canonical: `𝓛[f](α)`, `HessianLipschitzOn`,
  `cubicRegularizationLocalOptimalityMeasure`,
  `cubicRegularization_localOptimalityMeasure_tendsto_zero`, and the direct `MapClusterPt`
  predicate;
* bridge/view: the feasible-region level set `𝓕 ∩ 𝓛[f]((f x̄))` and the local
  notation `μ[M](x)` from `Definition_4_1_4` for the owner measure when `f` and `L` are fixed.

Primitive data:
* a cubic-regularization method and the underestimator condition along its trajectory;
* feasibility of the trajectory inside `𝓕`;
* boundedness of the feasible sublevel set `𝓕 ∩ 𝓛[f]((f (method i₀)))`;
* the lower-bound and Hessian-control hypotheses needed by the owner theorem
  `cubicRegularization_localOptimalityMeasure_tendsto_zero`;
* pointwise continuity data only for the source-facing quantity being evaluated at a cluster
  point.

Derived API:
* convergence of the objective values;
* nonemptiness and connectedness of the cluster-point set;
* convergence `μ_L(xᵢ) → 0` along the trajectory, via
  `cubicRegularization_localOptimalityMeasure_tendsto_zero`;
* value convergence and stationarity at cluster points;
* second-order positivity at cluster points after supplying the canonical pointwise `C²`
  Hessian-symmetry bridge.

This file therefore keeps only those theorem-level consequences and reuses the existing owner
declarations instead of carrying parallel local wrappers for level sets, cluster-point sets,
least-eigenvalue terms, or `μ_M`. The bounded-level-set asymptotics are stated over the proper
ambient-space layer coming from the trajectory owner, while the local-optimality consequences are
split into an intrinsic operator statement and a Euclidean matrix-view conclusion. -/

domain `𝓕` is stationary, i.e. `∇ f(x*) = 0`. This first-order conclusion lives on the intrinsic

-- Proof sketch: first invoke the chapter owner theorem
-- `cubicRegularization_localOptimalityMeasure_tendsto_zero` under the standing cubic-
-- regularization owner hypotheses to get `μ[L](xᵢ) → 0`; that owner theorem derives the
-- residual-cube descent estimate and the needed least-Hessian-eigenvalue lower bound from
-- `method`, so neither appears as separate public data here.
-- Then pass to a convergent subsequence
-- witnessing `MapClusterPt xStar atTop method`; the owner hypothesis
-- `[HessianLipschitzOn L 𝓕 f]` and the on-set assumption `x* ∈ 𝓕` supply the needed local `C²`
-- continuity bridge for `μ[L]` at `x*`, so `μ[L](x*) = 0`. Finally apply

/-- Theorem 4.1.2 (6): every limit point `x* ∈ X*` lying in the Hessian-Lipschitz owner domain
`𝓕` has positive semidefinite Hessian, i.e. `∇² f(x*) ⪰ 0`. This is the Euclidean matrix-view
bridge of the intrinsic second-order positivity conclusion. -/
-- Proof sketch: use `cubicRegularization_localOptimalityMeasure_tendsto_zero` as in part `(5)`
-- to get `μ[L](x*) = 0` at the cluster point. Then apply the intrinsic cluster-point owner theorem
-- `cubicRegularization_clusterPoint_hessian_isPositive` and transport that positivity to the
-- Euclidean matrix statement `(∇² f x*) ⪰ 0`; the required pointwise `C²` hypothesis is supplied
-- internally by `[HessianLipschitzOn L 𝓕 f]` together with `x* ∈ 𝓕`.
