/- Definition 4.1.5 lies in the regularized-Newton trajectory domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `Set.Ioc` in mathlib, the canonical owner for the admissible interval condition `M_k ∈ (0, 2L]`;
* `RegularizedNewton.acceptingParameters` in `Definition_4_1_16`, the later fixed-iterate
  acceptance owner that deliberately builds on top of, rather than inside, the weaker trajectory
  object defined here;
* `CubicRegularizationMethod` in `Algorithm_4_1_5`, the stronger Chapter 4 owner that adds
  accepted-step data and then forgets to the present relaxed iteration.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the relaxed trajectory data `x_k`, `M_k`, and `x_{k+1} = T_{M_k}(x_k)`;
* core/canonical: the iterate sequence, regularization sequence, and the interval owner
  `Set.Ioc 0 (2 * L)`;
* bridge/view: the coercion to the underlying trajectory `ℕ → X`.

Primitive data:
* the iterate sequence `x`;
* the regularization sequence `M_k`;
* the admissible-interval condition `M_k ∈ (0, 2L]`;
* the update law `x_{k+1} = T_{M_k}(x_k)`.

Derived API:
* the coercion to the iterate sequence;
* positivity of each `M_k`;
* the upper bound `M_k ≤ 2L`;
* positivity of `L`, derived from any admissible `M_k`.

The owner abstraction is therefore already the right one for this file: later chapter APIs add
acceptance or minimization data on top of this trajectory object, rather than replacing it by a
parallel wrapper. -/
/-- Definition 4.1.5: a relaxed regularized Newton iteration for a trial map `T_M` and constant
`L` consists of an iterate sequence `x_k` and regularization parameters `M_k` such that each
`M_k` lies in `(0, 2L]` and the update `x_{k+1} = T_{M_k}(x_k)` holds for every `k ≥ 0`. These
interval conditions force `L > 0`, recovered below as derived API. -/
