variable {E : Type u} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E] [CompleteSpace E]

/- Primary domain: twice continuously differentiable convexity criteria on open convex subsets of
real Hilbert spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* mathlib `ConvexOn`
* mathlib `(hessian f x).IsPositive`
* mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.isPositive_iff`
* Chapter 1 `fderiv_gradient_isSymmetric_of_contDiffAt`
* Chapter 2 `ConvexOn.gradient_monotone`

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing convexity owner: `ConvexOn ℝ Q f`
* canonical Hessian object at `x`: `hessian f x`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: convexity of `f` on the open convex set `Q`
* core/canonical: pointwise positivity of the Hessian operator
* bridge/view: nonnegativity of the associated quadratic form

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `Q`
* the objective `f`
* openness and convexity of `Q`
* `C²` regularity `ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f Q`

Derived API:
* `convexOn_iff_hessian_quadratic_form_nonneg`, obtained as the quadratic-form bridge from the
  canonical Hessian owner
* `convexOn_iff_hessian_isPositive`

The public theorem therefore stays centered on `ConvexOn ℝ Q f` and the owner property
`(hessian f x).IsPositive`. The quadratic-form statement is kept only as
the minimal bridge needed by downstream Hessian-bound files, and the textbook `ℝⁿ` statement is a
direct specialization. -/
