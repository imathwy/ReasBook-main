/- Primary domain: first-order convex minimization of differentiable objectives on real inner
product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar` in `Definition_2_1`, the Chapter 2 minimizer owner
* `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane` in `Definition_2_2`, the source-faithful first-order support
  inequality for convex functions
* `DifferentiableAt.differentiableWithinAt`, the bridge from ambient differentiability to the
  whole-space within-set derivative needed by `lower_tangent_plane`

Best owner abstraction:
* `ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ f` together with `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar`

Primitive data:
* the objective `f : E → ℝ`
* the candidate minimizer `xStar : E`
* whole-space convexity of `f`
* pointwise differentiability of `f` at `xStar`
* the stationary-gradient identity `∇ f xStar = 0`

Derived API:
* the textbook pointwise lower bound `∀ x, f xStar ≤ f x`
* the minimizing conclusion `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Theorem 2.1 for convex objectives with a stationary differentiable point
* core/canonical: `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane`
* bridge/view: `isMinOn_univ_iff`, converting the pointwise inequality into `IsMinOn`

/-- Helper for Theorem 2.1: the tangent-plane inequality at a stationary point gives the textbook
pointwise lower bound on the whole space. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply `ConvexOn.lower_tangent_plane` at the base point `xStar`, simplify the
-- whole-space gradient term to the ambient gradient, and then use `∇ f xStar = 0`.
