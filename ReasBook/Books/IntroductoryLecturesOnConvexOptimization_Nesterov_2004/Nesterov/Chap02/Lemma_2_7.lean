Primary domain: estimating-sequence gap bounds for real-valued function families.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `AffineMap.lineMap`
* `AffineMap.lineMap_apply_module`
* `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar`
* the downstream owner predicate `IsEstimatingSequence` in `Definition_2_21`

Best owner abstraction for this file:
* source-facing: the gap-control lemmas of Lemma 2.7
* core/canonical: the function-space affine upper model `lineMap f (phi 0) (lam k)` together with
  the minimizer owner `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar`
* bridge/view: the pointwise textbook expansion of `lineMap` given by `lineMap_apply_module`

Primitive data:
* the domain `X`, objective `f`, auxiliary models `phi k`, coefficients `lam k`, minimum values
  `phiStar k`, and sampled points `x k`
* the canonical function-space affine upper bound `phi k ≤ lineMap f (phi 0) (lam k)`
* a minimizer `xStar` of `f` on `Set.univ`

Derived API:
* the interval estimate for the optimality gap
* convergence of that gap to `0` under `lam ⟶ 0`

This file keeps the source-facing gap lemmas but uses the canonical affine owner `lineMap`
instead of a parallel raw affine-combination shell.

/-- Lemma 2.7: if each iterate value is bounded above by the minimum of `phi k`, and the
estimating functions `phi k` are bounded above by the canonical affine model
`lineMap f (phi 0) (lam k)`, then the optimality gap at stage
`k` lies in the interval `[0, lambda_k * (phi0 x* - f x*)]`. The source chapter applies this to
functions on `ℝⁿ`, but the proof is purely pointwise and therefore lives on an arbitrary domain
`X`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use `IsMinOn f Set.univ xStar` to obtain `f xStar ≤ f (x k)`, giving the lower
-- endpoint of the interval. For the upper endpoint, combine the hypothesis `f (x k) ≤ phiStar k`
-- with the fact that `phiStar k` is the minimum value of `phi k`, use the estimating-sequence
-- upper bound `phi k ≤ lineMap f (phi 0) (lam k)`, and then evaluate that affine model at
-- `xStar`.

/-- Under the assumptions of `estimatingSequence_gap_mem_Icc`, the optimality gap converges to
`0`. -/
-- Proof sketch: the previous interval estimate gives
-- `0 ≤ f (x k) - f xStar ≤ lam k * (phi 0 xStar - f xStar)` for every `k`. Since `lam k → 0`,
-- the
-- right-hand side tends to `0`, and the squeeze theorem yields convergence of the gap to `0`.
