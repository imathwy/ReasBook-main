Primary domain: sufficient-decrease and monotonicity for constant-step gradient descent on real
Hilbert spaces.

Owner-style declarations sampled before refining this file:
* `gradientMethod` in `Algorithm_2_1`, the Chapter 2 recall of the recursive trajectory owner;
* `gradient_step_value_decrease_of_contDiffOne_withLipschitzGradient` in `Chap01/Lemma_1_6_6`,
  the arbitrary-point owner theorem from which the chapter iterate theorem is derived;
* `Antitone` and `antitone_nat_of_succ_le`, the canonical decreasing-sequence owner and its
  `ℕ`-successor bridge recalled in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_1`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: Proposition 2.8's monotonicity statement for the constant-step trajectory;
* core/canonical: `Antitone (fun k ↦ f (traj k))`, obtained from the Chapter 1 iterate-wise
  sufficient-decrease theorem plus nonnegativity of the constant-step factor;
* bridge/view: the one-step inequality `f (traj (k + 1)) ≤ f (traj k)` recovered from
  `Nat.le_succ k`.

Primitive data:
* the objective `f`, the constant step `α`, and the initial point `x0`;
* the smoothness hypotheses `ContDiff ℝ 1 f` and `LipschitzWith L (∇ f)`.

Derived API:
* the antitone objective-value sequence and its one-step corollary.

This file derives the textbook iterate-wise decrease directly from the Chapter 1 pointwise owner
`gradient_step_value_decrease_of_contDiffOne_withLipschitzGradient`, then packages the
source-facing monotonicity consequence with `Antitone` as the main public owner statement and the
successor-step inequality as a thin bridge. The textbook `ℝⁿ` formulation is recovered by
specializing `E` to `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.

constant-step gradient-method trajectory form an antitone sequence. The source range
`0 < α ≤ 2 / L` is a special case, and the textbook `ℝⁿ` statement is recovered by specializing
