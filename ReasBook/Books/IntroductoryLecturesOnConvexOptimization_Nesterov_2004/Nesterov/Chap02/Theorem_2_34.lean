/- Theorem 2.34 lies in the nearest-point / convex-geometry domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `IsProjectionPointOn Q x p` in `Chap07/Definition_7_3`, the project owner predicate for
  nearest-point geometry;
* `IsProjectionPointOn.inner_sub_nonneg` in `Lemma_2_13`, the owner variational inequality for a
  projection point on a convex set;
* `euclideanProjection` and `euclideanProjection_isProjectionPointOn` in `Theorem_2_33`, the
  chosen map and its bridge back to the owner predicate once existence is available;
* `Submodule.lipschitzWith_orthogonalProjection` in mathlib's linear-subspace projection API,
  showing that the canonical map-level output for a projection operator is `LipschitzWith 1`.

Best owner abstraction:
* `IsProjectionPointOn Q x p`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: nonexpansiveness of metric projection onto a convex set;
* core/canonical: owner-level projection points `IsProjectionPointOn Q x p`;
* bridge/view: the selector-level `LipschitzWith 1` theorem and its specialization to the chosen
  map `euclideanProjection`.

Primitive data:
* the convex set `Q`, ambient points `x₁`, `x₂`, and projection points `p₁`, `p₂`.

Derived API:
* the intrinsic metric comparison `dist p₁ p₂ ≤ dist x₁ x₂` for owner-level projection points;
* the `LipschitzWith 1` theorem for any projection selector on `Q`;
* the chosen-map corollary for `euclideanProjection` once completeness supplies that selector.

The proof uses only real inner-product geometry. Completeness is therefore kept out of the
owner-level and selector-level statements, and is introduced only for the final bridge to the
chosen projection map from `Theorem_2_33`.

/-- Any two projection points onto a convex set are at most as far apart as their base points. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply the projection variational inequality to `hp₁` with the feasible point `p₂`
-- and to `hp₂` with the feasible point `p₁`. Adding the two inequalities gives
-- `‖p₁ - p₂‖ ^ 2 ≤ ⟪p₁ - p₂, x₁ - x₂⟫`, and Cauchy--Schwarz yields the desired bound.
