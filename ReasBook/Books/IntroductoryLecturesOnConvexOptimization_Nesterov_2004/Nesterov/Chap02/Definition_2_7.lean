Definition 2.7 lies in the second-order smooth-convex domain on finite-dimensional real
inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `ConvexC1SeminormSmooth` / `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]¹¹` in `Theorem_2_5`, the chapter owner for `C¹` convex
  objectives with `L`-Lipschitz gradient measured by `p`
* `ConvexC1SeminormSmooth.contDiff`, the canonical `C¹` regularity projection from that owner
* `convexC1SeminormSmooth_iff_hessian_quadratic_form_bounded` in `Theorem_2_6`, the bridge from
  the first-order owner plus `ContDiff ℝ 2` to the textbook Hessian inequalities
* `HasLipschitzContinuousHessian` / `f ∈ C22[L₃]` in `Chap04/Definition_4_2_7`, a nearby chapter
  pattern where a source-facing smoothness class is kept as a named owner and reuses canonical
  projections instead of duplicating its downstream API

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `ConvexC2SeminormSmooth p L f`, written on theorem surfaces as `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]²¹`
* core/canonical: `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]¹¹ ∧ ContDiff ℝ 2 f`
* bridge/view: Theorem 2.6's Hessian quadratic-form characterization

Primitive data:
* the smooth-convex owner hypothesis `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]¹¹`
* the second-order regularity hypothesis `ContDiff ℝ 2 f`

Derived API:
* the inherited convexity and gradient-Lipschitz consequences from `f ∈ 𝓕[L, p]¹¹`
* the `C²` projection
* the source-text Hessian inequalities recovered through Theorem 2.6

This file therefore restores the textbook class surface `𝓕_L^{2,1}` as a thin source-facing owner,
but it does not duplicate the first-order smooth-convex machinery or repackage the Hessian
characterization as new primitive data. The canonical pair remains the core definition, and
Theorem 2.6 supplies the bridge back to the textbook Hessian condition.

/-- Definition 2.7: a function belongs to the source-facing class `𝓕_L^{2,1}` when it already
lies in the chapter smooth-convex class `𝓕[L, p]¹¹` and is twice continuously differentiable. The
textbook Euclidean class `𝓕_L^{2,1}(ℝⁿ)` is the specialization `p = normSeminorm ℝ E`. -/
