Primary domain: convex-geometric owner subsets of `ℝ²`.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled for this core file:
* `Set.prod`, the canonical owner for coordinate-axis subsets such as `Ici 0 ×ˢ {0}`
* `ConvexOn.convex_epigraph`, the mathlib owner theorem for epigraph-style subsets
* `convexOn_iff_convex_epigraph`, the canonical bridge between convexity and epigraph convexity

Best owner abstraction:
* `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay : Set (ℝ × ℝ)`
* `nonnegativeFirstCoordinateRay : Set (ℝ × ℝ)`

Primitive data:
* the reciprocal epigraph region `Q`
* the nonnegative first-coordinate ray `ℝ_+^{1,2}`

Derived API:
* the companion membership lemmas

Source/core/bridge triage:
* core/canonical: the two owner sets in `Set (ℝ × ℝ)`
* bridge/view: the corresponding coordinate membership lemmas

/-- The set `Q`, viewed as the epigraph of `x ↦ 1 / x` on the positive first-coordinate ray. The
textbook coordinates `x^(1), x^(2)` are represented by `x.1, x.2`. -/

/-- Membership in `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay` means that the first coordinate is positive and
the second coordinate lies on or above the reciprocal graph `x₂ = 1 / x₁`. -/
