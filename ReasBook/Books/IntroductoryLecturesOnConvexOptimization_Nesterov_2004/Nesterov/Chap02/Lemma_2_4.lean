noncomputable section

/- Primary domain: quadratic norm inequalities over a seminormed additive group.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- `sq_nonneg`, the exact algebraic owner for the weighted quadratic inequality;
- `norm_sub_le`, the triangle inequality in subtraction form;
- `sq_le_sq₀`, the canonical passage from a nonnegative inequality to the squared inequality;
- `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`, the owner monotonicity lemma for nonnegative scalar multiplication;

Best owner abstraction:
- there is no higher project owner object here; the canonical owners are the four mathlib scalar
  and norm inequalities above, and this file should remain a thin source-facing bridge.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the two-step weighted quadratic chain from the textbook lemma;
- core/canonical: the four owner lemmas above;
- bridge/view: specializing those owner inequalities to the weights `α` and `1 - α`.

Primitive data:
- a seminormed additive group `E`,
- points `x y : E`,
- a weight `α : ℝ`.

Derived API:
- the two atomic weighted quadratic inequalities below;
- the chained quadratic bound of Lemma 2.4, recovered as a thin wrapper.

/-- For every real weight `α`, the weighted square of `‖x‖ + ‖y‖` is bounded above by the
corresponding affine combination of `‖x‖²` and `‖y‖²`. -/
-- Proof sketch: the difference between the right-hand side and the left-hand side is the exact
-- square `(α * ‖x‖ - (1 - α) * ‖y‖)^2`.

/-- For `α ∈ [0, 1]`, the weighted squared distance `‖x - y‖²` is bounded above by the weighted
