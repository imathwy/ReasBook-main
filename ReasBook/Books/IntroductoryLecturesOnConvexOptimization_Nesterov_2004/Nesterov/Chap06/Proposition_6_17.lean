/- Proposition 6.17 lies in the induced operator-norm domain for the weighted tuple geometry of
the continuous location model.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `Seminorm.primalDualOperatorNorm`, the chapter owner for induced norms between source and target
  seminorm geometries;
* `Seminorm.primalDualOperatorNorm_eq_sSup_dualPairing`, the owner-side source formula for the
  two-ball pairing supremum;
* `continuousLocationSmoothingMap`, the chapter owner for the weighted pairing
  `(x, u) ↦ ∑_j m_j ⟪u_j, x⟫`;
* `continuousLocationDualTupleNorm`, the source-facing weighted tuple norm on `ι → E`.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the textbook supremum of `∑_j m_j ⟪u_j, x⟫` over unit vectors `x` in the ambient
  real inner-product space `E` and weighted-dual unit tuples `u : ι → E`;
* core/canonical: `Seminorm.primalDualOperatorNorm` applied to the `PiLp`-transport of
  `continuousLocationSmoothingMap E weights` and the pullback seminorm
  `continuousLocationDualTupleSeminorm E weights`;
* bridge/view kept in this file: the weighted scaling map on `PiLp 2 (fun _ : ι ↦ E)` and the
  transported smoothing operator `continuousLocationSmoothingMapPiLp E weights`.

Primitive data:
* the population weights `weights`;
* the ambient real inner-product space `E`;
* the weighted tuple scaling linear map on `PiLp 2 (fun _ : ι ↦ E)`.

Derived API:
* the pairing map `continuousLocationSmoothingMap`;
* the transported pairing map `continuousLocationSmoothingMapPiLp`;
* the pullback seminorm owner `continuousLocationDualTupleSeminorm`;
* the canonical primal-dual operator norm of `continuousLocationSmoothingMap`;
* the source-facing sphere formula of Proposition 6.17 as a thin bridge.

/-- Proposition 6.17: rewriting the canonical induced-norm statement through
`continuousLocationSmoothingMap_primalDualOperatorNorm_eq_sqrt_totalPopulation`,
`Seminorm.primalDualOperatorNorm_eq_sSup_dualPairing`, `continuousLocationSmoothingMap_apply`, and
`continuousLocationDualTupleSeminorm_apply`, and then transporting back along
`PiLp.continuousLinearEquiv`, gives the source-facing unit-sphere formula for the weighted
pairing. -/
