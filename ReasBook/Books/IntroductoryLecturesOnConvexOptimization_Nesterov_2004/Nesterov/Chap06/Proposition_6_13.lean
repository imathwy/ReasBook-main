/- Proposition 6.13 lies in the Euclidean matrix operator-norm / Gram-spectrum domain.

Primary domain:
- real matrices equipped with the Euclidean induced operator norm.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Matrix.greatestEigenvalue` and the notation `λ_max(H)` in `Chap04/Definition_4_1_6`, the
  project owner for the largest real spectral value;
- mathlib's scoped `Matrix.Norms.L2Operator` norm `‖A‖`, the canonical Euclidean operator norm on
  matrices;
- the Gram matrix expression `Aᵀ * A`, whose largest eigenvalue controls the Euclidean operator
  norm.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the Euclidean operator norm of a real matrix;
- core/canonical: the ambient `Matrix.Norms.L2Operator` norm together with `λ_max`;
- bridge/view: the equivalent `sSup (spectrum ℝ (Aᵀ * A))` formulation used downstream.

-- Proof sketch: square the Euclidean operator norm, rewrite `‖A x‖^2` as the Rayleigh quotient
-- `xᵀ (Aᵀ * A) x`, identify its maximum over the unit sphere with `λ_max(Aᵀ * A)`, and then take
-- square roots.
