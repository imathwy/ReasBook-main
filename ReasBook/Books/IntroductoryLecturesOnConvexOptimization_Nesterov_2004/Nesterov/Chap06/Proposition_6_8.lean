-- Proof sketch: the estimate `‖v k - xStar‖² ≤ 2 * D` gives a uniform closed ball centered
-- at `xStar` containing every `v k`. Since each `x k` and `y k` lies in the convex hull of the
-- finite prefix `v 0, ..., v k`, convexity of that closed ball implies the same uniform bound for
-- `x k` and `y k`. Therefore the union of the three ranges is bounded.
/-- Helper for Proposition 6.8: each finite prefix convex hull of `v` is contained in the convex
hull of the full range of `v`. -/

/-- Proposition 6.8: if each `x_k` and `y_k` lies in the convex hull of the finite prefix
`v_0, ..., v_k` and the points `v_k` satisfy `‖v_k - xStar‖² ≤ 2 D` for all `k ≥ 0`, then
the three sequences are bounded, equivalently the union of their ranges is bounded. Here `D`
is the scalar value corresponding to the source quantity `d(xStar)`. -/
