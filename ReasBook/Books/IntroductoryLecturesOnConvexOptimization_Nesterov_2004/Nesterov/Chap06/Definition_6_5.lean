/- Definition 6.5 lies in the chapter's structured primal-dual convex-objective domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `StructuredObjectiveModel` in `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the exact chapter owner for the
  structured primal-dual data
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.objective` in `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the canonical derived
  objective on the primal set
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.objective_apply` in `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the exact source-facing
  evaluation formula
- `PrimalDualObjectiveModel` in `Chap06/Definition_6_28`, the later variant that adds
  nonemptiness hypotheses while already living at the same `NormedSpace` owner level

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing/core: `StructuredObjectiveModel`
- bridge/view: the coercion from `StructuredObjectiveModel` to its objective function on
  `problem.primalSet`

Primitive data:
- the primal and dual feasible sets together with boundedness, closedness, and convexity
- the functions `smoothPart`, `dualPenalty`
- the linear map `linearMap`
- the continuity and convexity hypotheses for `smoothPart` and `dualPenalty`

Derived API:
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.maximand`
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.objective`
- the coercion to `problem.primalSet → EReal`
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.objective_apply`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `StructuredObjectiveModel`
- core/canonical: the same owner already introduced in `Definition_6_6`
- bridge/view: the objective coercion and the evaluation theorem

The owner abstraction already exists in `Definition_6_6`, so this item should be a direct
recall surface rather than a duplicate local structure. The textbook formula for `f` is then
recovered through the owner objective and its evaluation theorem.

section

/- Definition 6.5: a structured objective model consists of bounded closed convex sets
`Q₁ ⊆ E₁` and `Q₂ ⊆ E₂`, continuous convex functions `\hat f` and `\hat φ`, and a linear
operator `A : E₁ → E₂*`; the associated primal objective is encoded by the recalled chapter
owner and its derived objective API. -/
