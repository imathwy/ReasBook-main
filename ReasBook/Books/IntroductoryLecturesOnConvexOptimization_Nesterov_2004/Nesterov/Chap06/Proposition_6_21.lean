/- Proposition 6.21 lies in the operator-norm bridge domain for the same row data that feed the
Chapter 6 owner `maxAbsoluteValueOptimizationObjective`.

Primary domain:
- canonical operator norms of continuous linear maps `E →L[ℝ] E₂`;
- the finite `ℓ¹` norm on `PiLp 1`;
- the signed row stack `a_i, -a_i` indexed by `ι ⊕ ι`, viewed through canonical product assembly.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `maxAbsoluteValueOptimizationObjective` in `Definition_6_21`, the nearby source-facing Chapter 6
  owner for the max-absolute-value optimization data;
- `ContinuousLinearMap.pi`, the canonical owner assembling a finite family of continuous linear
  functionals into a product-valued continuous linear map;
- `PiLp.continuousLinearEquiv`, the canonical equivalence between a finite product and the
  corresponding `PiLp` space;
- `ContinuousLinearMap.sSup_sphere_eq_norm`, the canonical operator-norm support formula.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the signed stacking operator-norm identity attached to the row family `a`;
- core/canonical: the ambient norm `‖·‖` on the canonical stacked map expression;
- bridge/view: the pointwise `ℓ¹` norm formula for that canonical stack.

Primitive data:
- a finite row family `a : ι → StrongDual ℝ E`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing signed stack `signedRowStack a`;
- the canonical stacked-map expression implementing `signedRowStack`, built from
  `ContinuousLinearMap.pi` and `PiLp.continuousLinearEquiv`;
- its pointwise `ℓ¹` norm identity;
- the operator-norm equality and the source bounds from Proposition 6.21.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `signedRowStack` together with
  `signedRowStack_opNorm_eq_two_mul_sSup_abs_rowSum` and `signedRowStack_opNorm_bounds`;
- core/canonical: `ContinuousLinearMap.pi`, `PiLp.continuousLinearEquiv`, and the ambient
  operator norm;
- bridge/view: `signedRowStack_norm_eq_two_mul_sum_abs`.

This file therefore introduces the source-facing signed stack only once, as the short bridge
`signedRowStack a`, and states Proposition 6.21 on that owner surface. Its implementation remains
the canonical composition of `ContinuousLinearMap.pi` with `PiLp.continuousLinearEquiv`.

-- Proof sketch: expand the `ℓ¹` norm in `PiLp 1`; the signed stack has coordinates
-- `a_i x` and `-a_i x` over `ι ⊕ ι`, so the absolute values add to

`x` is twice the sum of the absolute row evaluations. -/
