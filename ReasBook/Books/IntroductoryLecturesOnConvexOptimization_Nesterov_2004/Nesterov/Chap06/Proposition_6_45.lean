/- Proposition 6.45 lies in the chapter's structured saddle-slice / attained weak-duality-gap
domain.

Mandatory domain-style sampling before refinement:
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.saddleFunction` in `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the Chapter 6 owner for
  the saddle map `Ψ`;
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.objective` in `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the canonical primal outer
  value `x ↦ sup_u Ψ(x, u)`;
- `StructuredObjectiveModel.adjointObjective` in `Chap06/Definition_6_6`, the canonical dual
  outer value `u ↦ inf_x Ψ(x, u)`;
- mathlib `IsGreatest` and `IsLeast`, the canonical order-theoretic owners for attained maxima
  and minima of the two saddle slices.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the attained-extrema weak-duality-gap inequality from Proposition 6.45;
- core/canonical: `StructuredObjectiveModel.saddleFunction`;
- bridge/view: the order-theoretic comparison between an attained maximum of `u ↦ Ψ(x, u)` and an
  attained minimum of `y ↦ Ψ(y, u)`.

Primitive data:
- `problem : StructuredObjectiveModel E₁ E₂`;
- a primal point `x : problem.primalSet`;
- a dual point `u : problem.dualSet`.

Derived API:
- the fixed-`x` saddle slice `problem.saddleFunction x`;
- the fixed-`u` saddle slice `fun y : problem.primalSet ↦ problem.saddleFunction y u`;
- attained extrema of those slices, expressed canonically by `IsGreatest` and `IsLeast`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the proposition below on attained slice extrema;
- core/canonical: the Chapter 6 owner `StructuredObjectiveModel`;
- bridge/view: this real-valued attained-extrema corollary of the saddle slices.

The previous version kept the concrete Hilbert-space formula
`ψ(x) + ⟪A x, u⟫ - g(u)` as the main theorem surface. The mathematical content here is only the
order relation between the two slices of a saddle map, so the refined theorem is stated directly
on the Chapter 6 owner `StructuredObjectiveModel.saddleFunction`; the concrete bilinear formula is
already recovered elsewhere by `StructuredObjectiveModel.saddleFunction_apply`.

/-- Proposition 6.45: if `f̄(x)` is the attained maximum of the fixed-`x` saddle slice
`u ↦ Ψ(x, u)` on `Q₂` and `ḡ(u)` is the attained minimum of the fixed-`u` saddle slice
`y ↦ Ψ(y, u)` on `Q₁`, then the weak-duality gap `f̄(x) - ḡ(u)` is nonnegative. -/
