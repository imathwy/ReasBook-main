/- Theorem 5.4.6.6 lies in the subsection's self-concordant-barrier / recession-direction /
composition domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` from `Definition_5_3_2`, the chapter owner for a
  `μ`-self-concordant barrier on an open convex domain;
* `IsSelfConcordantOn` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter pattern for passing from a
  quantitative owner with an auxiliary constant to the source-facing existential owner when that
  constant is not part of the public statement;
* `compositionPotentialSigmaTwo` from `Theorem_5_4_6_5`, the source-facing owner for `σ₂`;
* `compositionSecondLiftedDirectionDerivative` from `Definition_5_4_6_7`, the source-facing owner
  for the lifted derivative direction `l' = (D²ξ(x)[d, d], 0)`;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith.inner_gradient_nonpos_of_recession_direction` from
  `Corollary_5_3_2`, the canonical barrier-owner recession-direction inequality;
* mathlib `Convex.add_smul_mem_interior`, the convex-interior bridge that transfers a recession
  direction of `Q₂` to one of `interior Q₂`.

Best owner abstraction:
* `∃ μ : NNReal, IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith (interior Q₂) μ Φ`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the nonnegativity conclusion for `σ₂` under the recession-direction hypothesis on
  `-l'`;
* core/canonical: the quantitative barrier owner `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` on `Φ` over
  `interior Q₂`;
* bridge/view: the lifted product direction `compositionSecondLiftedDirectionDerivative ξ x d`
  together with the internal `WithLp 2 (E₂ × E₃)` pullback used to apply the ambient pairing
  theorem.

Primitive data:
* `Φ`, `ξ`, `x`, `d`, `z`, the set `Q₂`, and the recession-direction hypothesis on `-l'`;
* the convexity of `Q₂`;
* the source-facing existence of some barrier parameter for `Φ` on `interior Q₂`.

Derived API:
* the lifted second derivative `l' = (D²ξ(x)[d, d], 0)` from `Definition_5_4_6_7`;
* the internal pullback barrier `w ↦ Φ w.ofLp` on the canonical `L²` product owner;
* the recession transfer from `Q₂` to `interior Q₂`;
* the nonpositivity of the ambient gradient pairing with the recession direction `-l'`.

The local public API should therefore stay on the source-facing existence of a barrier owner for
`Φ` on `interior Q₂`; the numerical barrier parameter is auxiliary proof data, the canonical `L²`
pullback is only an internal bridge, and the public statement must make the convexity of `Q₂`
explicit because that hypothesis is exactly what moves the recession-direction assumption from
`Q₂` to the barrier domain `interior Q₂`. -/

-- Proof sketch: pull the barrier back along `WithLp.ofLp` to the canonical `L²` product owner,
-- rewrite `σ₂` as the ambient gradient pairing of that pullback barrier with the lifted direction
-- `WithLp.toLp 2 l'`, transfer the recession-direction hypothesis on `-l'` from the convex set
-- `Q₂` to the barrier domain `interior Q₂`, and then apply
-- `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith.inner_gradient_nonpos_of_recession_direction`.
/-- Theorem 5.4.6.6: if the negative lifted derivative direction `-l'` is a recession direction
of `Q₂`, and if `Φ` is some self-concordant barrier on `interior Q₂`, then the term `σ₂` is
nonnegative. -/
