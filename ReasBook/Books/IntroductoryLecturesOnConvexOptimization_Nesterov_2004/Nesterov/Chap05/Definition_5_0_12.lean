noncomputable section

/- Definition 5.0.12 lies in the self-concordant local-norm / directional-slice domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
* `hessianLocalNorm` in `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for the Hessian-induced local norm;
* the notation `‖u‖[f; x]`, the source-facing surface for that owner;
* `hessianLocalNorm_def`, the bridge from the owner to the square root of the Hessian quadratic
  form;
* `directionalSlice` in `Definition_5_0_10`, the chapter's source-facing owner for restricting a
  function to an affine line;
* `Set.restrict`, the canonical mathlib owner for viewing an ambient function on a subtype domain.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the associated univariate reciprocal local-norm function along the line
  `t ↦ x + t • h`;
* core/canonical: the Hessian local norm `‖h‖[f; x + t • h]`;
* bridge/view: the expansion of that local norm as
  `Real.sqrt (inner ℝ h ((fderiv ℝ (∇ f) (x + t • h)) h))`.

Primitive data:
* a domain `dom`;
* a function `f`;
* a base point `x`;
* a direction `h`.

Derived API:
* the natural parameter set where the shifted point stays in `dom` and the local norm is
  positive;
* the reciprocal local-norm function as the canonical restriction of the ambient slice
  `t ↦ 1 / ‖h‖[f; x + t • h]` to that parameter set;
* companion theorems expanding the owner-level statements to the textbook Hessian formula.

This file therefore keeps the associated univariate function as the source-facing owner, but it is
implemented by the canonical restriction owner `Set.restrict` rather than by a bespoke subtype
lambda. The core owner is the chapter local norm `hessianLocalNorm`, and the raw square-root
formula is kept only as bridge API.
