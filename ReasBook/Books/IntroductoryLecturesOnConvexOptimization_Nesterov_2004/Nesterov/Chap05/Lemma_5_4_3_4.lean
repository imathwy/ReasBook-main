/- Lemma 5.4.3.4 lies in the Chapter 5 second-order-cone / self-concordant-barrier domain.

Sampled owner declarations in this domain:
* `secondOrderCone` and `mem_interior_secondOrderCone_iff` from `Lemma_5_4_3_3`, the chapter owner
  for the second-order cone as a `ConvexCone ℝ (E × ℝ)`;
* mathlib `WithLp 2 (E × ℝ)` together with `WithLp.ofLp`, the canonical `L²` ambient owner for
  barriers on the second-order cone;
* mathlib `ConvexCone.convex`, which derives convexity from that cone owner instead of storing a
  parallel set-level wrapper;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` from `Definition_5_3_2`, the chapter owner for self-concordant
  barriers;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith.barrierParameter_ge_sum_alpha_div_beta_of_recession_directions`
  from `Theorem_5_4_1_2`, the canonical lower-bound owner theorem specialized here.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the lower bound `ν ≥ 2` for barriers on the second-order cone;
* core/canonical: the raw-pair cone owner `secondOrderCone : ConvexCone ℝ (E × ℝ)` together
  with the barrier owner
  `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith ((fun z : Z ↦ z.ofLp) ⁻¹' interior K₂[E]) ν F`;
* bridge/view: the textbook inequalities `‖x‖ ≤ t` and `‖x‖ < t`, already exposed by
  `mem_secondOrderCone_iff` and `mem_interior_secondOrderCone_iff`, together with the source
  notation `K₂[E]` and the ambient bridge `z ↦ z.ofLp`.

Primitive data:
* a nontrivial real Hilbert-space ambient `E`, used only to choose a norm-one vector;
* the self-concordant barrier owner on the pulled-back interior
  `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith ((fun z : Z ↦ z.ofLp) ⁻¹' interior K₂[E]) ν F`.

Derived API:
* the source-facing lower bound `(2 : ℝ) ≤ (ν : ℝ)`.

This file therefore reuses the existing second-order-cone owner from `Lemma_5_4_3_3` instead of
keeping a parallel coordinate model. The source-facing cone notation remains on raw pairs, while
the barrier owner lives on the canonical `L²` product owner and is accessed through `z ↦ z.ofLp`.
The earlier `ℝⁿ` proof ingredient is refined to the intrinsic owner-level fact that a nontrivial
real normed space contains a norm-one vector. -/

-- Proof sketch: apply
-- `barrierParameter_ge_sum_alpha_div_beta_of_recession_directions` to
-- `secondOrderCone : ConvexCone ℝ (E × ℝ)` with base point `(0, 1)`, recession directions
-- `(h, 1)` and `(-h, 1)` for a unit vector `h : E`, and coefficients
-- `α₁ = α₂ = β₁ = β₂ = 1 / 2`. Transport the cone to the canonical `L²` product owner
-- `Z = WithLp 2 (E × ℝ)` through `z ↦ z.ofLp`; the backward steps land on the boundary, the
-- combined step reaches `(0, 0) ∈ K₂[E]`, and the general lower-bound theorem yields `1 + 1 ≤ ν`.
/-- Lemma 5.4.3.4: every `ν`-self-concordant barrier for the interior of the second-order cone
`K₂ = {(x, t) ∈ E × ℝ | ‖x‖ ≤ t}` in a nontrivial real Hilbert space `E`, viewed on the canonical
`L²` product ambient space through `z ↦ z.ofLp`, has barrier parameter at least `2`. Specializing
to `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` with `0 < n` recovers the textbook `ℝⁿ` statement. -/
