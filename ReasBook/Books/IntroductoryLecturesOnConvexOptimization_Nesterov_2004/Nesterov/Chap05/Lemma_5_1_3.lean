/- Lemma 5.1.3 lies in the chapter's self-concordance / line-derivative domain.

Sampled owner declarations in this domain:
* `thirdDirectionalDerivative` from `Definition_5_0_10`, the chapter owner for the cubic
  directional derivative;
* `directionalSlice` from `Definition_5_0_10`, the chapter owner for affine-line restriction;
* `hessianLocalNorm` and the notation `‖u‖[f; x]` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for
  the Hessian local norm;
* `associatedUnivariateFunction` from `Definition_5_0_12`, the source-facing reciprocal
  local-norm slice owner on the positivity domain;
* `associatedUnivariateFunctionDomain` from `Definition_5_0_12`, the source-facing owner for the
  natural positivity domain of that slice;
* nearby Chapter 5 line-derivative statements such as `Corollary_5_1_1` and `Theorem_5_1_4`,
  which already work over arbitrary complete real inner-product spaces.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the associated univariate reciprocal local-norm function and its natural domain
  along the affine line `t ↦ x + t • h`;
* core/canonical: `directionalSlice`, `thirdDirectionalDerivative f (x + t • h) h`, and
  `‖h‖[f; x + t • h]`;
* bridge/view: the ambient representative
  `directionalSlice (fun y ↦ 1 / ‖h‖[f; y]) x h` of
  `associatedUnivariateFunction dom f x h` on `associatedUnivariateFunctionDomain dom f x h`.

Primitive data:
* the objective `f`;
* the line data `x` and `h`;
* the open domain carrying `C³` regularity;
* the single point `t` of `associatedUnivariateFunctionDomain dom f x h`.

Derived API:
* the source-facing derivative bound for the reciprocal local-norm slice in terms of the chapter
  owners `thirdDirectionalDerivative` and `hessianLocalNorm`;
* the explicit derivative formula for the canonical affine-line bridge
  `directionalSlice (fun y ↦ 1 / ‖h‖[f; y]) x h` on
  `associatedUnivariateFunctionDomain dom f x h`.

This file therefore keeps `associatedUnivariateFunction` as the source-facing owner from
`Definition_5_0_12`, and its main public entry is the source-facing derivative bound for that
reciprocal local-norm slice. The explicit `HasDerivWithinAt` formula is only a bridge/view
statement because the one-variable calculus owner lives on ambient functions. Both statements use
the canonical ambient bridge `directionalSlice (fun y ↦ 1 / ‖h‖[f; y]) x h` on the natural domain
`associatedUnivariateFunctionDomain dom f x h`, not an ad hoc zero-extension. The Chapter 5
differential-calculus API used here already lives over complete real inner-product spaces, so
finite dimensionality is not part of the canonical statement. -/
