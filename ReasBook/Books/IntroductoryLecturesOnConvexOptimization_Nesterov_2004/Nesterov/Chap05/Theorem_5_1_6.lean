Theorem 5.1.6 belongs to the Chapter 5 self-concordance / closed-convex domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
* `IsSelfConcordantOn` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the source-facing qualitative owner when the
  value of the self-concordance constant is not part of the statement;
* `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn` from `Definition_5_0_23`, the chapter owner for pointwise
  Hessian positivity together with strict Hessian quadratic-form positivity on a domain;
* `IsSelfConcordantOnWith` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the quantitative owner used only after
  unpacking a witness from `IsSelfConcordantOn`;
* `hessian` from `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the canonical second-order owner replacing the raw
  `fderiv ℝ (∇ f)` shell;
* `hessianLocalNorm` and `hessianLocalNorm_def` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the canonical bridge
  from the Hessian owner to the local norm;
* `constrainedEpigraph` from `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the chapter owner for the source epigraph
  over a feasible domain, whose closedness supplies the missing hypothesis from the source
  theorem.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: strict positivity of the Hessian quadratic form in every nonzero direction under
  qualitative self-concordance and the source no-affine-line hypothesis;
* core/canonical: `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn dom f`, the Hessian owner `hessian f x`, and the
  Chapter 3 constrained-epigraph owner on `dom`;
* bridge/view: pointwise positivity and strict local-norm positivity read canonically via
  `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn.hessian_isPositive_of_mem`,
  `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn.posdef`, and `hessianLocalNorm_def`.

Primitive data:
* the ambient complete real inner-product space `E`;
* a domain `dom`, objective `f`, and the closed constrained epigraph
  `constrainedEpigraph dom (fun y ↦ (f y : WithTop ℝ))`;
* the no-affine-line hypothesis on `dom`.

Derived API:
* the chapter owner `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn dom f`.

This file keeps the numbered theorem source-facing, but its core output is now the chapter owner
`HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn dom f`. Downstream pointwise Hessian and local-norm positivity are
read from that owner through `HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn.hessian_isPositive_of_mem`,
`HasPositiveDefiniteHessianOn.posdef`, and `hessianLocalNorm_def` instead of new local wrapper
theorems. -/
