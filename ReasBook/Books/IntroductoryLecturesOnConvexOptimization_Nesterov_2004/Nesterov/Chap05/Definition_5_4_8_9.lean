-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Definition 5.4.8.9 lies in the chapter's real epigraph domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
- `constrainedEpigraph` and `mem_constrainedEpigraph_iff` from `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the
  chapter owner for epigraphs over a feasible set;
- `mem_constrainedEpigraph_negLog_iff` from `Definition_5_4_8_5`, the nearby chapter pattern for
  specializing this owner to a one-variable barrier epigraph;
- `ConvexOn.convex_epigraph`, the standard convex-epigraph owner theorem;
- `LowerSemicontinuous.isClosed_epigraph`, the standard closed-epigraph owner theorem.

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical:
  `constrainedEpigraph (Set.Ici (0 : ℝ))
    (fun x : ℝ ↦ ((x * Real.log x : ℝ) : WithTop ℝ))`.

Primitive data:
- the nonnegative half-line `[0, ∞)`;
- the function `x ↦ x log x`.

Derived API:
- the specialized epigraph expression itself;
- its membership expansion.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook set `Q₃`;
- core/canonical: the chapter epigraph owner `constrainedEpigraph`;
- bridge/view: the specialized membership theorem below.

This item therefore keeps the source-facing owner `Q₃` while realizing it directly through the
chapter epigraph owner, deleting the parallel local set `qThreeEpigraph`. -/
