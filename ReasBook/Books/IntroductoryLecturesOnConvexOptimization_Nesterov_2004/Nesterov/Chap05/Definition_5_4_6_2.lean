/- Definition 5.4.6.2 lies in the chapter's cone-ordered higher-derivative / barrier-compatibility
domain for vector-valued maps.

Sampled owner declarations:
* mathlib `iteratedFDeriv`, the canonical multilinear owner for repeated Fréchet derivatives;
* `secondDirectionalDerivative` and `thirdDirectionalDerivative` from `Definition_5_0_10`, the
  chapter's scalar directional-derivative owners built from the same `iteratedFDeriv` data;
* `hessianLocalNorm` / notation `‖h‖[F; x]` from `Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for the
  barrier-side Hessian factor;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` from `Definition_5_3_2`, the canonical owner for the barrier
  hypothesis.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `IsBetaCompatibleWith Q₁ K F β ξ`;
* core/canonical: `iteratedFDeriv` and `hessianLocalNorm`;
* bridge/view: the short vector-valued repeated-direction abbreviations below.

Primitive data:
* the domain `Q₁`, cone `K`, barrier `F`, parameter `β`, and map `ξ`;
* convexity and interior nonemptiness of `Q₁`;
* the lower bound `1 ≤ β`;
* existence of a self-concordant barrier structure on `interior Q₁`;
* `C³` regularity of `ξ` on `interior Q₁`;
* the cone-order compatibility inequality.

Derived API:
* `vectorSecondDirectionalDerivative` and `vectorThirdDirectionalDerivative`, which only package
  repeated evaluation of `iteratedFDeriv`;
* the theorem-level owner consequence exposing the defining compatibility inequality from an
  ambient instance.

The owner abstraction stays `IsBetaCompatibleWith`; only the repeated-direction bridge names are
kept as a small shared vocabulary for the subsection, so downstream files can reuse them instead
of re-declaring parallel local copies. -/

/-- Definition 5.4.6.2: a map `ξ : E₁ → E₂` is `β`-compatible with the barrier `F` relative to
the cone `K` when `Q₁` is convex with nonempty interior, `β ≥ 1`, `F` is a self-concordant
barrier on `interior Q₁`, `ξ` is three-times continuously differentiable on `interior Q₁`, and
for every `x ∈ interior Q₁` and every direction `h` the cone-order inequality
`D^3 ξ(x)[h,h,h] \preceq_K -3 β D^2 ξ(x)[h,h] ⟨∇²F(x) h, h⟩^{1/2}` holds, encoded as membership
of the difference in `K`. -/
