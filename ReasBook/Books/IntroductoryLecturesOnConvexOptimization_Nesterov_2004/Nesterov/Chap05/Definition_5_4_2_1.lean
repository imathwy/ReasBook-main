open scoped PolarSet

/- Definition 5.4.2.1 lies in the chapter's based-polar-set domain.

Sampled declarations before refinement:
- project `polarSet`
- project `mem_polarSet_iff`
- mathlib `StrongDual.polar`
- mathlib `StrongDual.mem_polar_iff`

Best owner abstraction:
- the chapter owner `polarSet`

Primitive data:
- a set `Q`
- a base point `xBar`

Derived API:
- the textbook based polar as the polar of the displacement set `Q -ᵥ {xBar}`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook based polar `P(xBar)`
- core/canonical: `polarSet`
- bridge/view: `polarSetAt`

The strong-dual mathlib polar is not the exact owner here because it uses the absolute-value bound
on continuous linear functionals rather than the one-sided real inner-product inequality from the
chapter. The correct refinement is therefore to keep the chapter owner `polarSet` and express the
based variant as its displacement-set bridge. No extra notation is introduced here: the recurring
owner notation already lives on `Qᵒ`, while the based object is a view depending on `xBar`.

/-- Definition 5.4.2.1, generalized from the textbook Euclidean setting: the polar set of `Q`
with respect to the base point `xBar` is the chapter polar of the displacement set
`Q -ᵥ ({xBar} : Set E)`. Specializing to `E = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` recovers the textbook
definition. -/

/-- Membership in `polarSetAt Q xBar` is exactly the defining uniform inner-product inequality over
the displacement vectors from `xBar` to points of `Q`. -/
