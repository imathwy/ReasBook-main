Definition 7.79 lies in the constrained stochastic-programming domain.

Mandatory domain-style sampling before refinement:
- `ProbabilityMeasure` and `IsProbabilityMeasure` in mathlib's measure-theoretic probability API,
  the canonical owner for a probability law;
- `AffineVariationalInequalityProblem.gapProblem` in `Chap06/Definition_6_18`, the project
  pattern for a source-facing optimization object whose canonical Chapter 1 bridge lives on the
  feasible subtype;
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the project owner for a
  feasible set together with a real-valued objective;
- `IsMaxOn` and `isMaxOn_iff` in mathlib's extremum API, the canonical owner for maximization on
  a set;
- `LinearPackingProblem.toSetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap07/Definition_7_41`, the
  nearby chapter pattern for representing a maximization problem canonically via a negated
  minimization bridge.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `OneStageStochasticProgram X Ω Ξ`;
- core/canonical: `ProbabilityMeasure Ω` for the probability law,
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem problem.feasibleSet` for the expected-payoff optimization
  owner on feasible decisions, and `IsMaxOn problem Set.univ` for optimality;
- bridge/view: `realizedPayoff`, `expectedPayoff`, and `toSetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set of static decisions;
- the probability law, random input, payoff, and the measurability/integrability hypotheses needed
  to define the expected payoff on feasible decisions.

Derived API:
- the realized payoff `ω ↦ payoff x ξ(ω)` of a feasible decision;
- the expected-payoff objective on the feasible subtype;
- the Chapter 1 constrained-minimization bridge with negated objective on the feasible subtype;
- the source optimality notion expressed directly through `IsMaxOn problem Set.univ`;
- the explicit quantified optimality form via `isMaxOn_univ_iff`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `OneStageStochasticProgram` and the expected-payoff / optimal-static-decision
  surfaces below;
- core/canonical: `ProbabilityMeasure`, `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, and `IsMaxOn`;
- bridge/view: `realizedPayoff`, `expectedPayoff`, `toSetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, and the
  companion equivalence theorems below.

The textbook presents the random vector in `ℝ^m`, but the mathematical content used here only
needs a measurable input space. This refinement therefore keeps the same source meaning while
moving the stochastic-input layer to the intrinsic measurable-space owner level; the textbook case
is recovered by specializing `Ξ` to `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)`.

/-- Definition 7.79: a one-stage stochastic programming problem consists of a feasible set of
static decisions, a probability law, a measurable random input `ζ`, and a jointly measurable
payoff function whose expectation is well-defined for every feasible decision. The textbook `ℝ^m`
random-vector presentation is the specialization to `Ξ = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)`. -/
