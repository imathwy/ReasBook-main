variable {p n : ℕ}

local notation "Mₙ" => Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ

/- Proposition 7.5 lies in the chapter's Frobenius-Gram / dense arithmetic-cost domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Matrix.gram` in mathlib, the canonical Frobenius Gram-matrix owner for a family of
  coefficient matrices;
- `matrix_gram_apply_eq_entrywise_sum` in `Chap07/Definition_7_21`, the Chapter 7 bridge from
  that owner to the textbook Frobenius double sum;
- `linearMatrixGramOperator_toMatrixOrthonormal` in `Chap07/Definition_7_21`, the bridge from the
  source-facing operator `G = L†L` to its Gram matrix;
- `gramMatrix` in `Chap07/Proposition_7_24`, another use of the same canonical Gram owner.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the preliminary arithmetic-work bound for forming the Frobenius Gram matrix and
  inverting it;
- core/canonical: `Matrix.gram ℝ` on matrix-entry coordinates;
- bridge/view: `matrix_gram_apply_eq_entrywise_sum`.

Primitive data:
- `n`, `p : ℕ`.

Derived API:
- the canonical Frobenius Gram owner `Matrix.gram ℝ`;
- the parameter-only arithmetic-work expression
  `frobeniusGramPreliminaryArithmeticWorkBound n p`;
- its explicit expansion and regime-specific quadratic bound.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the arithmetic complexity statement of Proposition 7.5;
- core/canonical: `Matrix.gram ℝ`;
- bridge/view: the entrywise identity `matrix_gram_apply_eq_entrywise_sum`.

The previous file kept local raw-matrix inner-product scaffolding just to mention the Gram owner.
This refinement deletes that scaffolding and reuses the Chapter 7 Frobenius Gram owner directly,
leaving this file to own only the new arithmetic-work model and its asymptotic consequence.
