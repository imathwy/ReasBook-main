/- Definition 7.66 lies in filtered asymptotic-complexity estimates.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- mathlib `Asymptotics.IsBigO`, the canonical Landau owner behind `f =O[l] g`;
- mathlib `Asymptotics.isBigO_iff`, the canonical existential expansion of `=O[l]`;
- mathlib `Asymptotics.IsBigO.trans`, the owner-level composition API used by nearby Chapter 7
  complexity bounds.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the Chapter 7 soft-`O` relation, which remembers a size parameter and allows an
  omitted polylogarithmic factor;
- core/canonical: `Asymptotics.IsBigO`;
- bridge/view: the definitional expansion below from soft-`O` to ordinary `O` after restoring a
  power of `log (size + 2)`.

Primitive data:
- a filter `l`;
- a size parameter `size : α → ℕ`;
- the compared functions `f g : α → ℝ`.

Derived API:
- the witness `logPower : ℕ`;
- the canonical `=O[l]` comparison after reinstating the logarithmic factor.

There is no upstream soft-`O` owner in mathlib, so this file keeps the source-facing notion, but
places it directly in the `Asymptotics` namespace because its mathematical core is an
`Asymptotics.IsBigO` statement rather than a Chapter-7-specific wrapper. -/

/-- Source-facing owner for Definition 7.66: a soft-`O` bound for `f` by `g` relative to a size
parameter `size` means that the corresponding `O` bound holds after reinstating some omitted
logarithmic factor, formalized here as a power of `log (size + 2)`. -/

`Asymptotics.IsBigO` owner. -/

after restoring a power of the omitted logarithmic factor `log (size + 2)`. -/
