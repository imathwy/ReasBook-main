/-- Proposition 3.1.1.3, generalized from the textbook `ℝⁿ` setting: a continuous convex
real-valued function on a real topological module is a closed convex function; equivalently, after
coercing `f` to `WithTop ℝ`, its epigraph is a closed convex subset of `X × ℝ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: for the `WithTop ℝ`-valued coercion of `f`, the effective domain is all of `X`,
-- so `ClosedConvexFunction` reduces to closedness and convexity of the usual epigraph.
-- Convexity is exactly `hf_convex.convex_epigraph`, and closedness follows from
-- `IsClosed.epigraph isClosed_univ hf_cont.continuousOn`.
