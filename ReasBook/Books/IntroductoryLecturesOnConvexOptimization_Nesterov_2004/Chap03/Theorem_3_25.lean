open scoped ConstrainedArgmin WithTopConvexAnalysis

universe u

/- Theorem 3.25 is a `bridge/view` recall in the chapter's extended-valued convex-analysis
minimizer/common-subdifferential domain.

Primary mathematical domain:
- effective-domain minimizers of `WithTop ℝ`-valued convex functions and their
  common-subdifferential optimality criterion.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `IsMinOn` and `isMinOn_iff` in mathlib, the canonical minimizer predicate on a set;
- `constrainedArgmin` and `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the canonical
  minimizer-set owner on a feasible set;
- `commonRegularSubdifferential` and `mem_commonRegularSubdifferential_iff` in
  `Definition_3_1_5_4`, the chapter owner API for common subdifferentials;
- `subset_constrainedArgmin_effectiveDomain_iff_zero_mem_commonRegularSubdifferential` in
  `Theorem_3_1_20`, the upstream chapter theorem for this exact optimality statement.

Best owner abstraction:
- `argmin[dom f] f` together with
  `subset_constrainedArgmin_effectiveDomain_iff_zero_mem_commonRegularSubdifferential`.

Primitive data:
- an extended-valued function `f`;
- a set `XStar`.

Derived API:
- the minimizer-set owner `argmin[dom f] f`;
- its atomic membership theorem `mem_constrainedArgmin_iff`;
- the zero-common-subgradient optimality criterion.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook criterion identifying sets of global minimizers by the common
  regular subdifferential;
- core/canonical: `argmin[dom f] f` together with the theorem in `Theorem_3_1_20`;
- bridge/view: this numbered recall surface.

The previous file duplicated a local owner `globalMinimizers` for the canonical minimizer set
`argmin[dom f] f`, together with a parallel membership theorem. The chapter theorem in
`Theorem_3_1_20` now lives directly on the canonical owner surface, so this file reuses that
surface instead of preserving the redundant wrapper vocabulary. -/
