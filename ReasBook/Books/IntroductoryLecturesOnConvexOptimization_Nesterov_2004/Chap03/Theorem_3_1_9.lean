/- Theorem 3.1.9 lies in the convex-composition domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- mathlib `ConvexOn`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.comp`
- chapter theorem `ConvexOn.comp_of_monotoneOn`
- mathlib `Monotone.monotoneOn`

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing layer here: the whole-space specialization
- chapter bridge owner: `ConvexOn.comp_of_monotoneOn`
- core/canonical: mathlib `ConvexOn.comp`

Primitive data:
- a convex set `domψ`
- an inner map `ψ : X → Y`
- an outer map `φ : Y → Z`
- convexity of `ψ` on `domψ`
- convexity of `φ` on all of `Y`
- monotonicity of `φ` on all of `Y`

Derived API:
- convexity of the composition `φ ∘ ψ` on `domψ`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: convexity of `φ ∘ ψ` on `domψ` under whole-space assumptions on `φ`
- core/canonical: `ConvexOn.comp`
- bridge/view reused here: `ConvexOn.comp_of_monotoneOn`

Whole-space convexity of `φ` does not by itself restrict to `ConvexOn 𝕜 (ψ '' domψ) φ`, because
that would additionally require convexity of the image set `ψ '' domψ`. The chapter already
packages the correct owner-level bridge for this stronger whole-space hypothesis as
`ConvexOn.comp_of_monotoneOn`, so this file should specialize that chapter theorem rather than
maintain a second parallel proof body.

/-- Theorem 3.1.9: if `ψ` is convex on its domain `domψ ⊆ X`, and `φ : Y → Z` is convex and
nondecreasing on all of `Y`, then the composition `x ↦ φ (ψ x)` is convex on `domψ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: combine the convex upper bound for `ψ` with monotonicity of `φ`, then apply the
