/- Definition 3.27 lies in the convex optimization domain with linear equality constraints.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem` in `Chap02/Definition_2_30`, the earlier project owner of an
  ambient feasible set, a real-valued objective, and the linear equality data `A x = b`;
* `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem.equalityFeasibleSet` in `Chap02/Definition_2_30`, the owner
  projection to the intrinsic feasible region cut out by `x ∈ Q` and `A x = b`;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the ambient feasible-set /
  objective owner extended by `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem`;
* `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`, the mathlib bridge from the textbook matrix presentation to the
  intrinsic linear-map owner.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `LinearEqualityConstrainedConvexProblem E Λ`;
* core/canonical: `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem E Λ`;
* bridge/view: the equality-feasible-set projection
  `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem.equalityFeasibleSet`, together with the Euclidean matrix
  realization obtained by specializing `E`, `Λ`, and `A` to `EuclideanSpace` and
  `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`.

Primitive data:
* the ambient feasible set `Q`, objective `f : E → ℝ`, linear map `A`, and right-hand side `b`,
  owned canonically by `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem E Λ`;
* closedness of `Q` and convexity of `f` on `Q`.

Derived API:
* convexity of `Q`, recovered canonically from `objective_convex`;
* the intrinsic equality-feasible region `problem.equalityFeasibleSet`, inherited from the
  Chapter 2 owner;
* any later full-row-rank / surjectivity hypotheses on `A`, which belong on downstream theorems
  rather than in the owner data.

This file therefore keeps the convex problem itself source-facing, but the equality-constraint
layer is owned by `PrimalEqualityConstrainedProblem` instead of being restated locally. The
textbook matrix presentation is a specialization via `Matrix.toEuclideanLin`, not the main owner.
Its primitive data only use the topological/module layer on `E`, so the public owner does not
freeze normed structure into Definition 3.27 itself.

/-- Definition 3.27: a convex optimization problem with linear equality constraints consists of an
ambient closed convex set `Q`, a convex objective `f` on `Q`, a linear map `A`, and a right-hand
side `b`, encoding the program `min_{x ∈ Q} {f x : A x = b}`. In the textbook Euclidean
realization, `A` is represented by a matrix; full row rank is an additional theorem-level
assumption on that matrix presentation, not primitive owner data. -/
