/- Theorem 3.1.2.2 belongs to the chapter's closed-convex affine-pullback calculus.

Primary domain:
- closed convex `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions and affine preimages of constrained epigraphs on real
  topological modules.

Sampled owner-style declarations in this domain:
- `ClosedConvexOn` from `Definition_3_1_1_5`
- `ClosedConvexOn.isClosed_constrainedEpigraph`
- `ClosedConvexOn.convex_constrainedEpigraph`
- mathlib `ContinuousAffineMap`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.comp_affineMap`

Best owner abstraction:
- `ClosedConvexOn`

Primitive data:
- the owner witness `hφ : ClosedConvexOn S φ`
- the continuous affine map `g : X →ᴬ[ℝ] Y`

Derived API:
- the owner pullback theorem `ClosedConvexOn.comp_continuousAffineMap`
- the Euclidean specialization `ClosedConvexOn.comp_affineMap`
- the epigraph-preimage bridge used in the proof

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the theorem asserting closed convexity of the affine pullback on `g ⁻¹' S`
- core/canonical: `ClosedConvexOn`
- bridge/view: the constrained-epigraph preimage under
  `g.prodMap (ContinuousAffineMap.id ℝ ℝ)`, together with the Euclidean specialization from
  affine maps to continuous affine maps

The public owner theorem therefore lives directly in the `ClosedConvexOn` namespace at the
continuous-affine-map level. The textbook `ℝⁿ` affine-map statement remains as a thin
finite-dimensional specialization, while the epigraph preimage argument stays internal to the
proof rather than becoming a parallel wrapper declaration.

/-- Closed convexity is preserved by precomposition with a continuous affine map. This is the
canonical owner-level pullback theorem; Euclidean affine-map statements should be derived from it.

-- Proof sketch: identify the constrained epigraph of the pullback with the preimage of
-- `constrainedEpigraph S φ` under the affine map `(x, t) ↦ (g x, t)`. Closedness follows from
-- continuity of this map, and convexity follows from preservation of convexity under affine
-- preimages.

section AffineMap

/-- Theorem 3.1.2.2: if `φ` is closed and convex on `S ⊆ ℝᵐ` and `g : ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ` is affine, then
the pullback `x ↦ φ (g x)` is closed and convex on the affine preimage `{x | g x ∈ S}`. This is
the finite-dimensional specialization of `ClosedConvexOn.comp_continuousAffineMap`. -/
