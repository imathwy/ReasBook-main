/- Lemma 3.11 lies in the chapter's extended-valued convex-analysis / affine subdifferential
calculus on Euclidean spaces.

Sampled owner declarations:
- mathlib `ConvexOn.comp_affineMap`
- `ClosedConvexOn.comp_affineMap`
- `IsSubgradientAt.comp_affineMap`
- `subdifferential`
- `mem_subdifferential_iff`

Best owner abstractions:
- `ClosedConvexOn` for the closed-convex affine-pullback statement
- `IsSubgradientAt` and `subdifferential` from `Definition_3_1_5` for the affine subgradient
  calculus statement

Primitive data:
- the affine map `g : Eₙ →ᵃ[ℝ] Eₘ`
- the ambient closed-convex hypothesis `ClosedConvexOn S φ`
- the owner-level subgradient predicate `IsSubgradientAt f (g x) h`

Derived API:
- the recalled owner theorem `ClosedConvexOn.comp_affineMap`
- the Euclidean bridge theorem `subdifferential_comp_affineMap_image_adjoint_subset`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Lemma 3.11's two affine-pullback consequences, namely closed convexity on
  `g ⁻¹' S` and the adjoint-image inclusion for the subdifferential
- core/canonical: `ClosedConvexOn`, `IsSubgradientAt`, and `subdifferential`
- bridge/view: `ConvexOn.comp_affineMap`, which underlies the closed-convex owner theorem, and
  the finite-dimensional set-level subdifferential inclusion derived from
  `IsSubgradientAt.comp_affineMap`

This file therefore recalls the assumption-free closed-convex owner theorem directly and keeps
only the thin affine subdifferential bridge theorem that specializes
`IsSubgradientAt.comp_affineMap` to the
source-facing subdifferential statement. -/

/-- Lemma 3.11, subdifferential part: every subgradient of `f` at `g x` pulls back along the
adjoint of the linear part of `g`. In set form, the adjoint image of `∂ f((g x))` is contained in
`∂ (f ∘ g)(x)`. In Euclidean coordinates, when `g y = A y + b`, the pullback is under `Aᵀ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: unpack membership in `subdifferential f (g x)` into the owner predicate
-- `IsSubgradientAt f (g x)`. The owner theorem `IsSubgradientAt.comp_affineMap` pulls that
-- subgradient back along `g.linear.adjoint`, and `mem_subdifferential_iff` repackages the result
-- into the set-valued statement.
