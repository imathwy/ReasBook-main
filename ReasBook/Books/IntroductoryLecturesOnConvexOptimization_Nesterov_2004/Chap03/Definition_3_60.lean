/- Definition 3.60 lies in the chapter's bounded-polyhedron / polyhedral-localization domain on
real inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `innerLePolyhedron` in `Definition_3_62`, the chapter owner for a finite system of half-space
  inequalities in a real inner-product space;
- `mem_innerLePolyhedron_iff` in `Definition_3_62`, the canonical membership expansion of that
  owner set;
- `IsPolyhedron` in `Chap01/Definition_1_1_4_5`, the chapter's canonical finite affine-presentation
  predicate;
- `isPolyhedron_of_eq_innerLePolyhedron` in `Definition_3_62`, the owner-side bridge from the
  half-space presentation to the chapter polyhedron predicate;
- `Bornology.IsBounded` in mathlib, the ambient owner predicate for bounded subsets.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: a set `Q` together with boundedness and a presentation
  `Q = innerLePolyhedron a b`;
- core/canonical: the owner set constructor `innerLePolyhedron` and the chapter predicate
  `IsPolyhedron`;
- bridge/view: `isPolyhedron_of_eq_innerLePolyhedron`.

Primitive data:
- a bounded ambient set `Q`;
- a finite index size `m`;
- half-space normals `a : Fin m → E`;
- scalar bounds `b : Fin m → ℝ`.

Derived API:
- the owner set `innerLePolyhedron a b`;
- its polyhedral consequence `IsPolyhedron (innerLePolyhedron a b)`.

There is no separate project-level owner predicate for bounded polyhedra, so the numbered item is
kept as a source-facing predicate on sets. The word `polytope` contributes genuine boundedness,
while the displayed formula is captured by the chapter owner presentation
`Q = innerLePolyhedron a b`.

-- Proof sketch: unpack the defining half-space presentation from
-- `hQ : IsPolyhedralLocalizationSet Q` and apply
-- `isPolyhedron_of_eq_innerLePolyhedron`; boundedness is additional source data and is not needed
-- for the polyhedral bridge.
