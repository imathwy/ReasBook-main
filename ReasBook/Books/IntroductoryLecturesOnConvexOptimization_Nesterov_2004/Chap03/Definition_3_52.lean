Definition 3.52 lies in the cutting-plane localization-recursion domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `cuttingHalfspace` in `Definition_3_49`, the chapter owner for the retained one-step affine cut;
- `localizationSet` in `Theorem_3_2_9`, the closed-form stage set cut out by the first `k + 1`
  inequalities;
- `mem_localizationSet_iff` in `Theorem_3_2_9`, the canonical membership expansion of that
  closed-form stage set;
- `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme.localizer` in `Algorithm_3_6`, a downstream owner that consumes this
  recursive localization family.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the recursive localization family `localizationSets`;
- core/canonical: the retained half-space cut `cuttingHalfspace`;
- bridge/view: the earlier closed-form stage description `localizationSet`.

Primitive data:
- the initial feasible region `Q`;
- the query sequence `xSeq`;
- the cutting-vector sequence `gSeq`.

Derived API:
- the recursive zero and successor equations for `localizationSets`;
- the identification of `localizationSets Q xSeq gSeq (k + 1)` with the earlier closed-form owner
  `localizationSet Q xSeq gSeq k`.

Accordingly, this file keeps the source-facing recursive object public, reuses the canonical
half-space owner for the successor step, and treats the earlier closed-form stage set only as a
bridge/view of the same recursion. -/

/-- Definition 3.52: given an initial set `Q`, a sequence `X = (x_k)`, and associated vectors
`g_k`, the localization sets are defined recursively by `S₀(X) = Q` and
`S_{k+1}(X) = {x ∈ S_k(X) | ⟪g_k, x_k - x⟫ ≥ 0}`. In the textbook this is specialized to
`Q ⊆ ℝⁿ`. -/
