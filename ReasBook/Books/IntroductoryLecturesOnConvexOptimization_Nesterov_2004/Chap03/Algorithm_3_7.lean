/- Primary domain: centroid-based cutting methods for bounded convex minimization on a finite-
dimensional real inner-product space.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `ConvexMinimizationWithSeparationOracle` in `Definition_3_51` for the ambient bounded closed
  convex feasible set with nonempty interior and its feasible-point subgradient guarantee;
- `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme` and `cuttingHalfspace` in `Algorithm_3_6` for the chapter's
  canonical cutting-plane owner and retained affine half-space cut;
- `localizationSets` in `Definition_3_52` for the chapter's canonical recursive localization-set
  owner;
- `setAverage` in `Definition_3_54` for the iterate `x_k = ⨍ x in S_k, x`.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing layer: the recursive centroid localizers `S_k`, their centroids `x_k`, and the
  chosen feasible-point subgradients `g_k`;
- core/canonical layer: the owner feasible set `Q`, `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme`,
  `cuttingHalfspace`, `setAverage`, and `localizationSets`;
- bridge/view layer: the induced `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme` and the identification
  `S_k = localizationSets Q x g k`.

Primitive data:
- the owner bounded convex minimization problem with feasible-set geometry and oracle.

Derived API:
- the recursive localization sets `S_k`;
- the centroids `x_k = cg(S_k)`;
- the feasible-point cut vectors `g_k`;
- the admissibility invariant that every `S_k` is again a bounded closed convex body with nonempty
  interior, `x_k ∈ S_k`, and `S_k ⊆ Q`;
- the bridge to the chapter's `GeneralCuttingPlaneScheme` owner;
- the bridge to the canonical localization-set recursion.

Accordingly, this file keeps Algorithm 3.7 source-facing: the recursion is on centroid cuts inside
the feasible set, but the retained cut itself is expressed through the owner half-space
`cuttingHalfspace`; the owner oracle is used only through its feasible-point subgradient branch at
the recursively certified centroid iterates. -/
