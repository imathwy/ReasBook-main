/- Theorem 3.9 is a recall-only `Set.univ` specialization in the chapter's closed-convex
pointwise-supremum domain.

Primary domain:
- subset-indexed pointwise suprema of `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions and their closed-convex
  stability.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `pointwiseSupremumOn`
- `pointwiseSupremumOnEffectiveDomain`
- `ClosedConvexOn`
- `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`

Best owner abstraction:
- the core owner theorem `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`;
- the source-facing surface in this numbered item is only the `Δ = Set.univ` specialization.

Primitive data:
- none in this file; the owner object and theorem already live upstream.

Derived API:
- this recall-only `Set.univ` specialization.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the pointwise-supremum closed-convex stability theorem over all indices;
- core/canonical: `pointwiseSupremumOn`, `pointwiseSupremumOnEffectiveDomain`, and
  `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_sSup`;
- bridge/view: the `Set.univ` specialization.

This file now recalls the canonical subset-indexed owner theorem directly instead of depending on
the former bridge theorem name `ClosedConvexOn.pointwise_iSup`. The nonemptiness hypothesis
remains essential because the `Set.univ` specialization needs a nonempty index set.
