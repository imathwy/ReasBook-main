/- Corollary 3.1.7 lies in finite-family whole-space convex analysis.

Primary domain:
- finite log-sum-exp convexity on a real module.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- mathlib `ConvexOn`, the canonical owner for convexity on a set;
- mathlib `convex_univ`, the canonical whole-space convex-domain theorem;
- mathlib `LinearMap.convexOn`, a standard source of whole-space convex examples;
- project `convexOn_log_sum_exp_of_convexOn`, the chapter owner theorem on a common domain.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the whole-space finite log-sum-exp convexity statement;
- core/canonical: `convexOn_log_sum_exp_of_convexOn`;
- bridge/view: specialization of the common-domain owner theorem to `Set.univ`.

Primitive data:
- a finite index set `t : Finset ι`;
- a family `f : ι → E → ℝ`;
- whole-space convexity of each member `f i`.

Derived API:
- convexity of `x ↦ log (∑ i ∈ t, exp (f i x))` on `Set.univ`.

The previous file-level theorem was only the `Set.univ` specialization of the owner theorem, with
no extra mathematical content. This file therefore keeps only the direct owner-level specialization
check instead of a parallel local theorem name.
