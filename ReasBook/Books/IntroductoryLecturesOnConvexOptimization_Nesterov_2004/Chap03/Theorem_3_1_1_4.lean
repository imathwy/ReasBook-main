-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Theorem 3.1.1.4 lies in the chapter's closed-convex-function domain.

Primary domain:
- closed convex `WithTop ℝ`-valued functions on real topological modules.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `ClosedConvexOn` and `ClosedConvexFunction` in `Definition_3_1_1_5`
- `ClosedConvexOn.isClosed_constrainedEpigraph`
- `ClosedConvexOn.convex_constrainedEpigraph`
- `constrainedEpigraph` in `Definition_3_3`

Best owner abstraction:
- `ClosedConvexFunction f`

Primitive data:
- the effective domain `withTopEffectiveDomain f`
- the closedness and convexity of the constrained epigraph packaged by
  `ClosedConvexFunction f`

Derived API:
- the closedness and convexity of the real sublevel sets `{x | f x ≤ β}`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Theorem 3.1.1.4 itself, the sublevel-set consequence of closed convexity
- core/canonical: `ClosedConvexFunction`
- bridge/view: `constrainedEpigraph`

This item is therefore kept at the owner-theorem layer and reduced to the actual source-facing
sublevel-set statement, without introducing separate set owners or additional minimizer/existence
results under the numbered theorem. -/

/-- Theorem 3.1.1.4: every real sublevel set of a closed convex function is closed and convex. -/
-- Proof sketch: identify `{x | f x ≤ β}` with the horizontal slice of the closed convex epigraph
-- of `f` at height `β`; closedness and convexity are inherited from that slice.
