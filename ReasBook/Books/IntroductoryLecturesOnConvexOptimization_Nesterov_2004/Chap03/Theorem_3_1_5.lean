/- Theorem 3.1.5 records the textbook closure rules for extended-real-valued functions on
feasible sets.

Semantic recall:
- `ClosedConvexOn` from `Definition_3_1_1_5`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.smul`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.add`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.sup`
- mathlib `LowerSemicontinuousOn.add`
- mathlib `LowerSemicontinuousOn.sup`
- mathlib `lowerSemicontinuousOn_iff_isClosed_epigraph`

Source alignment note:
- part (1) is recorded on the textbook convexity / lower-semicontinuity bridge surface over the
  stated feasible set, because the stronger owner `ClosedConvexOn` is not preserved by zero
  scaling on nonclosed feasible sets;
- parts (2) and (3) remain on the chapter owner surface `ClosedConvexOn` over the stated
  intersection feasible set;
- the stronger owner-level scaling variant therefore remains only as the auxiliary theorem
  `ClosedConvexOn.nonneg_smul_of_isClosed`.

namespace ClosedConvexOn

-- Semantic recall: mathlib provides `ConvexOn.smul`, `ConvexOn.add`, and `ConvexOn.sup` for the
-- convexity half of these closure rules, while the chapter owner `ClosedConvexOn` packages the
-- feasible-domain and constrained-epigraph closedness data.

/-
Theorem 3.1.5 is represented below by three source-facing clause theorems. Nonnegative scaling
uses the textbook bridge surface `ConvexOn ∧ LowerSemicontinuousOn`, because the current chapter
owner `ClosedConvexOn` is strictly stronger than the textbook notion at `β = 0`; the addition and
pointwise-maximum clauses stay on the chapter owner over the intersection feasible set.
