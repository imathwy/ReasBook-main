/- Proposition 3.1.1.6 lies in the chapter's finite-dimensional `ℓ₁`-geometry / convex-hull
domain.

Layer targeted by this refinement:
- source-facing proposition stated at the canonical `ℓ₁`-closed-ball owner layer

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `EuclideanSpace.l1Seminorm`
- `Seminorm.closedBall`
- `l1_ball_eq_convexHull_signed_standard_basis_prop`

Best owner abstraction:
- `(EuclideanSpace.l1Seminorm n).closedBall x₀ r`

Primitive data:
- the ambient dimension `n : ℕ`
- the center `x₀ : E`
- the radius `r : ℝ`

Derived API:
- the convex-hull description of that closed ball by the signed standard-basis vertices, already
  established in `Proposition_3_7`

Dimension side condition:
- `0 < n`, excluding the degenerate `n = 0` case where the signed-vertex set is empty while the
  closed ball is nonempty for `r ≥ 0`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the `ℓ₁` closed ball / signed-vertex convex-hull equality
- core/canonical: `Seminorm.closedBall` for `EuclideanSpace.l1Seminorm n`
- bridge/view: this recall-only file

`Proposition_3_7` now already states the proposition on the canonical closed-ball owner surface.
Keeping a second theorem here with the same interface would only duplicate that owner-level API
under a different name, so this file is recall-only.
