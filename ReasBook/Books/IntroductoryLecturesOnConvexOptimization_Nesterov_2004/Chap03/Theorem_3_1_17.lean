/- Theorem 3.1.17 is a `bridge/view` Euclidean specialization in the chapter's convex
directional-derivative domain.

Primary domain:
- convex directional derivatives and subdifferentials of `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions on `ℝⁿ`.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `convexDirectionalDerivative` in `Theorem_3_21`, the chapter owner for the extended-valued
  directional derivative;
- `subdifferential_convexDirectionalDerivativeReal_at_zero_eq_subdifferential` in
  `Theorem_3_21`, the canonical subdifferential comparison theorem;
- `convexDirectionalDerivativeReal_isGreatest_subgradientPairing_of_mem_interior` in
  `Theorem_3_21`, the canonical max-formula theorem;
- `dom`, `withTopRealPart`, and `subdifferential` from `Definition_3_3` and `Definition_3_1_5`,
  which already own the effective-domain and subgradient vocabulary used here.

Best owner abstraction:
- the chapter owner `convexDirectionalDerivative`, together with the canonical finite
  theorem-level `toReal` view used under interior hypotheses, and the
  subdifferential owner `∂ f(x)`.

Primitive data:
- none in this file; the directional-derivative construction and subdifferential owners are
  already defined upstream.

Derived API:
- this Euclidean recall surface for the subdifferential identity and max formula.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the Euclidean specialization of the directional-derivative subdifferential
  identity and max formula;
- core/canonical: `convexDirectionalDerivative` and `subdifferential`;
- bridge/view: this recall file.

The previous version redefined the effective domain, finite real part, subdifferential, and
directional derivative locally on `ℝⁿ`. Those were duplicate wheels once `Theorem_3_21`,
`Definition_3_3`, and `Definition_3_1_5` became the chapter owners. This file now reuses the
canonical owner vocabulary directly and keeps only the Euclidean specialization layer. -/

variable {f : E → WithTop ℝ} {x0 : E}

/-- Theorem 3.1.17: for a convex `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function on `ℝⁿ`, the
subdifferential with respect to the direction variable of `p ↦ f'(x₀; p)` at
`0` coincides with the subdifferential of `f` at `x₀`. The companion
directional-derivative max formula is recalled immediately below in the
canonical `IsGreatest` owner form. -/
-- This Euclidean bridge theorem restates the owner-level subdifferential
-- identity already proved upstream in `Theorem_3_21`.

form for the image of the subdifferential under `g ↦ ⟪g, p⟫`. -/
