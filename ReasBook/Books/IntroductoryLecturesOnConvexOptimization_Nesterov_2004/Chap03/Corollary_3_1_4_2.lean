open scoped ConvexAnalysis SupportFunction

/- Corollary 3.1.4.2 belongs to the chapter's support-function comparison domain.

Primary domain:
- support functions of subsets of a real Hilbert space and the extended-real effective domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
- `extendedRealEffectiveDomain` / `dom` from `Definition_3_1_1_2`
- `supportFunction` from `Definition_3_9`
- `subset_of_supportFunction_le_on_domain` from `Theorem_3_17`
- `supportFunction_eq_on_common_domain_implies_eq` from `Theorem_3_17`

Source-facing layer:
- equality of closed convex sets from agreement of their support functions on the common
  finite-value domain, with empty/nonempty status already encoded by the shared effective domain.

Core/canonical layer:
- the owner constructions `extendedRealEffectiveDomain` and `supportFunction`, together with the
  exact comparison theorem `supportFunction_eq_on_common_domain_implies_eq`.

Bridge/view:
- the companion inclusion theorem `subset_of_supportFunction_le_on_domain`.

Primitive data:
- the sets `Q₁`, `Q₂` and the canonical support-function/effective-domain constructions.

Derived API:
- the inclusion and equality comparison theorems for those owner constructions.

This file therefore reuses the exact owner theorem from `Theorem_3_17` instead of keeping a
parallel local copy of `supportFunction`, `extendedRealEffectiveDomain`, and the same comparison
statement under a second name.
