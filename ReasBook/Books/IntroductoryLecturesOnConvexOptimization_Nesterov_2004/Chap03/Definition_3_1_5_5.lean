/- Definition 3.1.5.5 lies in the source-facing domain of bounded intersections for set-valued
maps.

Primary domain:
- bounded intersections of set-valued maps.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `Set.iInter`;
- `Set.mem_iInter₂`.

Best owner abstraction:
- the common-value set attached to a set-valued map on a set.

Primitive data:
- a domain type `α`;
- a codomain type `β`;
- a set-valued map `S : α → Set β`;
- an index set `X : Set α`.

Derived API:
- the bounded-intersection owner `⋂ x ∈ X, S x`;
- the membership bridge `Set.mem_iInter₂`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `commonValueSet`;
- core/canonical: `Set.iInter`;
- bridge/view: `Set.mem_iInter₂`.

This file keeps the source-facing object aligned with the textbook notation `\hat{\mathcal S}(X)`
while realizing it directly by the canonical bounded intersection over `X`. -/
