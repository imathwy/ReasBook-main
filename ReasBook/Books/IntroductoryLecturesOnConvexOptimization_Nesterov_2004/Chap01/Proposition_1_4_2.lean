/- Proposition 1.4.2 lies in the order-theoretic monotone-convergence domain.

Relevant owner declarations sampled before refining:
* `Antitone`, the owner predicate for a decreasing sequence
* `antitone_nat_of_succ_le`, the canonical bridge from the textbook one-step decrease
  condition to the owner predicate on `ℕ`
* `tendsto_atTop_ciInf`, the owner monotone-convergence theorem for antitone nets
* `sInf_range`, the bridge from the indexed infimum `⨅ n, a n` to the textbook
  `sInf (Set.range a)`

Best owner abstraction:
* `tendsto_atTop_ciInf`

Primitive data:
* the source-facing one-step decrease condition `∀ n, a (n + 1) ≤ a n`
* `BddBelow (Set.range a)`

Derived API:
* `Antitone a`, via `antitone_nat_of_succ_le`
* convergence of `a` to `sInf (Set.range a)`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the proposition that a bounded-below relaxation sequence converges to the
  infimum of its range from the textbook one-step decrease hypothesis
* core/canonical: `tendsto_atTop_ciInf`
* bridge/view: `antitone_nat_of_succ_le` and `sInf_range`

This file therefore keeps only the source-facing theorem and targets the canonical proof route via
`antitone_nat_of_succ_le`, `tendsto_atTop_ciInf`, and `sInf_range` without introducing any local
wrapper around monotonicity or infimum convergence.

/-- Proposition 1.4.2: A bounded-below relaxation sequence converges to the infimum of its
range. -/
-- Proof sketch: convert the successor-step decrease hypothesis to `Antitone a` via
-- `antitone_nat_of_succ_le`, then apply `tendsto_atTop_ciInf` and rewrite `⨅ n, a n` as
-- `sInf (Set.range a)` using `sInf_range`.
