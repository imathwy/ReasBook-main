variable {E : Type u} [TopologicalSpace E]

/- Primary domain: continuous real-valued maps that detect a subset through their zero set.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `C(E, ℝ)`, the canonical owner for continuous real-valued maps;
* `Set.EqOn`, the canonical localized equality predicate for functions on a set;
* `IsBarrierFunctionOn` in `Chap01/Definition_1_10_18`, the nearby chapter owner predicate on a
  bundled continuous map;
* `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.zero_on_compl` in mathlib, a nearby owner property organized around a
  vanishing condition rather than extra wrapper data.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `IsPenaltyFunction F Phi`;
* core/canonical: the bundled continuous map `Phi : C(E, ℝ)`;
* bridge/view: the exact zero-locus identity `F = Phi ⁻¹' {0}` and its pointwise reformulations.

Primitive data:
* `Phi` is globally nonnegative;
* the exact zero-locus identity `F = Phi ⁻¹' {0}`.

Derived API:
* the pointwise characterizations `x ∈ F ↔ Phi x = 0` and `Phi x = 0 ↔ x ∈ F`;
* `EqOn Phi 0 F`;
* strict positivity on `Fᶜ`;
* closedness of `F`.

The source phrase "closed set" is therefore redundant here: once the zero set is part of the owner
data, closedness follows immediately from continuity. -/

/-- Definition 1.10.14: for a set `F` in the ambient space, a continuous real-valued map is a
penalty function for `F` if it is nonnegative and vanishes exactly on `F`. The customary
strict-positivity statement on the complement is derived API. -/
