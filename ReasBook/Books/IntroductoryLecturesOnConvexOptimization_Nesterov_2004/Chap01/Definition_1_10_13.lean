/- Definition 1.10.13 lies in the Chapter 1 constrained/unconstrained minimization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `IsMinOn f Set.univ x` in mathlib, the canonical whole-space minimizer predicate;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_3`, the Chapter 1 owner for a
  feasible set together with its real-valued objective;
* `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.optimalValue` and
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.optimalValue_eq_of_isMinOn` in `Chap01/Definition_1_3_7`,
  the derived optimal-value API for that owner object;
* `PenaltyFunctionMethod.toSequentialUnconstrainedMinimizationScheme` in
  `Chap01/Algorithm_1_10_11`, the nearby source-facing algorithm that bridges to this scheme
  owner.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `SequentialUnconstrainedMinimizationScheme Q`;
* core/canonical: for each index `k`, the Chapter 1 owner
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem Q` specialized to feasible set `Set.univ`;
* bridge/view: the canonical owner problem `scheme.auxiliaryProblem k`.

Primitive data:
* the auxiliary objective family `Φₖ : Q → ℝ`;
* the iterate family `xₖ : Q`;
* the minimizing certificates `IsMinOn (Φₖ) Set.univ xₖ`.

Derived API:
* the associated Chapter 1 owner problem on the subtype `Q`;
* its optimal value and attained-value identities.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the sequential unconstrained minimization scheme itself;
* core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem Q`;
* bridge/view: packaging each `Φₖ` as the owner problem with feasible set `Set.univ`.

The file therefore keeps the source-facing scheme structure and reuses the Chapter 1 owner object
directly for optimal-value language, instead of introducing a parallel public auxiliary-problem
wrapper. -/

/-- Definition 1.10.13: A sequential unconstrained minimization scheme for a nonlinear
optimization problem with functional constraints consists of auxiliary unconstrained objective
functions `Φₖ : Q → ℝ` and iterates `xₖ ∈ Q` such that each `xₖ` minimizes `Φₖ` on `Q`. The
owner abstraction is the intrinsic feasible type `Q`; any surrounding constrained-problem package
or ambient-set presentation is auxiliary context used only when specializing this generic scheme.
The auxiliary objectives are intended to approximate a solution of the original constrained
problem.
