open HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound

variable {r : ℕ → ℝ} {c : ℝ}

/- Proposition 1.7.6 lies in the chapter's scalar superlinear-convergence domain.

Primary domain:
* quadratic tail estimates and logarithmic complexity thresholds for real error sequences

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound`
* `quadratic_tail_bound`
* `quadratic_tail_le_of_logb_bound`
* `HasSuperlinearRateOfConvergence` in `Definition_1_8_15.lean`

Best owner abstraction:
* `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0`

Primitive data:
* the sequence `r`
* the constant `c`
* the base index `K`
* the owner recurrence witness `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0`

Derived API:
* the quadratic tail estimate from `K`
* the logarithmic threshold consequence forcing `r (K + j) ≤ ε`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the explicit Proposition 1.7.6 tail and threshold consequences
* core/canonical: the owner-namespace theorems `quadratic_tail_bound` and
  `quadratic_tail_le_of_logb_bound`
* bridge/view: direct recall only; this file adds no extra mathematics beyond the owner
  hypotheses or their canonical local consequences

The former file kept standalone theorem names for owner-derived consequences. Those consequences
now live with the owner abstraction, and Proposition 1.7.6 reuses them directly. -/
