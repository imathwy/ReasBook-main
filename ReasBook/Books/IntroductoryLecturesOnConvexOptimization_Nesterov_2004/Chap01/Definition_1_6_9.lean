Primary domain: scalar asymptotic convergence rates for real optimization error sequences.

Source/core/bridge triage for Definition 1.6.9:
* source-facing: `HasConvergenceRateOfOrder r φ`
* core/canonical: the eventual comparison bound
  `∃ C > 0, ∀ᶠ N in atTop, r N ≤ C * φ N`, packaged with
  `IsOptimizationErrorSequence r`
* bridge/view: the asymptotic consequence `HasConvergenceRateOfOrder.isBigO`, and direct
  downstream use of the square-root specialization
  `HasConvergenceRateOfOrder r (fun N ↦ 1 / Real.sqrt (N : ℝ))`

Relevant declarations sampled before refining:
* `Asymptotics.isBigO_iff'`
* `Asymptotics.IsBigO.of_bound`
* `HasGeometricRateOfConvergence.isBigO` in `Definition_1_2_6.lean`
* `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0` in `Definition_1_2_7.lean`, a neighboring
  chapter example where a specialized owner is reused directly instead of wrapped by a duplicate
  local predicate

Owner abstraction:
* the source-facing eventual comparison bound from Definition 1.6.9, packaged with the
  optimization-error-sequence hypothesis; bare `r =O[atTop] φ` is only a companion bridge
  because it inserts absolute values

Primitive data:
* the sequence `r`
* the comparison rate `φ`
* the nonnegativity and convergence-to-zero hypothesis `IsOptimizationErrorSequence r`
* a witness `C > 0` and the eventual bound `r N ≤ C * φ N` along `atTop`

Derived API:
* the projection lemmas `error` and `bound`
* the asymptotic bridge `isBigO`

/-- A convergence rate of order `φ` yields the canonical asymptotic estimate `r =O[atTop] φ`. -/
-- Proof sketch: the source-facing eventual bound already forces `φ` to be eventually nonnegative,
-- because `r` is nonnegative and the comparison constant is positive. Convert the resulting
-- norm bound directly with `IsBigO.of_bound`.
