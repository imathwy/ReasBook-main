Primary domain: scalar convergence rates for real error sequences.

Source/core/bridge triage for Definition 1.2.7:
* source-facing: the textbook quadratic-rate statement
  `∃ c > 0, ∀ k, r (k + 1) ≤ c * r k^2`;
* core/canonical: `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0`;
* bridge/view: the equivalence between that owner specialization and the explicit quadratic
  recurrence.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* the scalar owner `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound`, introduced below and reused by
  `HasSuperlinearRateOfConvergence` in `Definition_1_8_15.lean`;
* the owner `HasGeometricRateOfConvergence` and the source-facing linear-rate condition in
  `Definition_1_2_6.lean`;
* the direct square-root specialization
  `HasConvergenceRateOfOrder r (fun N ↦ 1 / Real.sqrt (N : ℝ))` in
  `Definition_1_6_9.lean`.

Owner abstraction:
* `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0`

Primitive data:
* the sequence `r`
* the constant `c`
* the owner recurrence witness `HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0`

Derived API:
* the textbook quadratic recurrence `r (k + 1) ≤ c * r k^2`
* the source-facing existential statement from Definition 1.2.7
* the linear one-step estimate derived once `c * r k ≤ 1 / 2`
* the Proposition 1.7.6 tail estimate and logarithmic threshold consequence in the quadratic case

This file therefore recalls the owner specialization directly and removes the redundant alias
`HasQuadraticRateOfConvergence`. The numbered item is the canonical specialization
`∃ c > 0, HasEventuallySuperlinearErrorBound r 0 c 0`, while the explicit quadratic recurrence
remains available through the two atomic bridge lemmas below.

/-- An error sequence has an eventual superlinear bound with lag `lag` from index `N` onward if
the textbook estimate
`r_{k+1} ≤ c * r_k * r_{k-lag}`
holds for every `k ≥ N`, with `N` chosen large enough that the lagged term is available. -/
