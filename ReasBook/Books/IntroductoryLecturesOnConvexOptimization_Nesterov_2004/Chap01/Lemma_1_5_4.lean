/- Lemma 1.5.4 is `source-facing` in second-order smooth optimization.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* `source-facing`: the textbook equivalence between an `L`-Lipschitz gradient and the pointwise
  operator-norm bound `‖∇² f(x)‖ ≤ L` under `C²` regularity
* `core/canonical`: the owner hypotheses `LipschitzWith L (∇ f)` from Definition 1.5.2 and the
  Hessian operator `hessian f x` from Definition 1.4.16
* `bridge/view`: the pointwise real inequality `‖hessian f x‖ ≤ L`

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `gradient`
* `hessian f x`, the chapter's intrinsic Hessian owner from Definition 1.4.16
* `norm_fderiv_le_of_lipschitz`
* `lipschitzWith_of_nnnorm_fderiv_le`

Owner abstraction:
* the gradient map `∇ f` together with its canonical Hessian operator `hessian f x`

Primitive data:
* a twice continuously differentiable function `f`
* a Lipschitz constant `L`

Derived API:
* the global Lipschitz predicate `LipschitzWith L (∇ f)`
* the pointwise Hessian-operator bound `∀ x, ‖hessian f x‖ ≤ L`

The theorem is stated on a real Hilbert space, and specializing `E` to `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`
recovers the textbook `ℝⁿ` formulation. -/

/-- Bridge form of Lemma 1.5.4: once the gradient map is differentiable, `∇ f` is globally
`L`-Lipschitz if and only if the Hessian operator satisfies the pointwise norm bound
`‖∇² f(x)‖ ≤ L`, expressed through the chapter owner `hessian f x`. -/
