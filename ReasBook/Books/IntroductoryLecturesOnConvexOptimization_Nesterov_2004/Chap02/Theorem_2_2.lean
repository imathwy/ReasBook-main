Primary domain: convex analysis on affine modules over a linearly ordered ring, centered on the
owner predicate `ConvexOn 𝕜 Q f`.

Sampled owner-style declarations before refining this file:
* mathlib `ConvexOn`
* mathlib `convexOn_iff_forall_pos`
* mathlib `convexOn_iff_div`
* Chapter 2 `convexOn_iff_lower_tangent_plane` in `Definition_2_2`, the chapter's matching
  owner-to-textbook bridge for first-order convexity

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the one-parameter Jensen inequality along segments in `Q`
* core/canonical: `ConvexOn 𝕜 Q f`
* bridge/view: rewriting the owner weights `(a, b)` as the single parameter `α ∈ Icc 0 1`

Primitive data:
* the feasible set `Q`
* the objective `f`
* convexity of `Q`, supplied separately as `hQ`
* the canonical owner predicate `ConvexOn 𝕜 Q f`

Derived API:
* the one-parameter segment inequality below, obtained by taking weights `α` and `1 - α`
* the converse reconstruction of the owner theorem from that source-facing form and `hQ`

The owner abstraction is `ConvexOn 𝕜 Q f`. The source theorem is stated for `ℝⁿ`, but this
segment-normalized bridge only uses the ordered-ring/module layer already supporting
`convexOn_iff_forall_pos`; no division or inverse-based data is needed. The textbook `C¹` side
condition is redundant for this item, so the refined public API omits it. -/

variable {Q : Set E} {f : E → 𝕜}

/-- Theorem 2.2: on a convex set `Q`, convexity of `f` is exactly the usual two-point Jensen
inequality along every segment in `Q`. Specializing `𝕜` to `ℝ` recovers the textbook setting. -/
-- Proof sketch: `ConvexOn 𝕜 Q f` packages the two-weight Jensen inequality. The displayed
-- source-facing formula is its specialization `b = 1 - α`; conversely, `convexOn_iff_forall_pos`
-- recovers the owner theorem from that normalized one-parameter form and `hQ`.
