-- Declarations for this item will be appended below by the statement pipeline.

/- Primary domain: strong convexity on convex subsets of `ℝⁿ` with respect to an explicit
norm-like seminorm.

Sampled owner-style declarations before refining this file:
* mathlib `UniformConvexOn.add`
* mathlib `ConvexOn.smul`
* project `StrongConvexOnWith` in `Definition_2_14`
* project `StrongConvexOnWith.nonneg_combo_inter` in `Definition_2_14`

Best owner abstraction:
* `StrongConvexOnWith p μ Q f`

Primitive data:
* the owner predicate `StrongConvexOnWith p μ Q f`

Derived API:
* `StrongConvexOnWith.nonneg_combo_inter`, which belongs with the rest of the owner API in
  `Definition_2_14`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the weighted-sum closure statement
* core/canonical: `StrongConvexOnWith.nonneg_combo_inter`
* bridge/view: later Euclidean specializations should reuse that owner theorem directly

This numbered item is therefore a direct owner recall, not a second declaration site.

/- Lemma 2.6 is the direct owner recall of nonnegative weighted-sum closure for
`StrongConvexOnWith`. -/
