Primary domain: elementary Euclidean convex geometry in `ℝ²`, centered around the textbook disk
`Q₁`.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refining:
* `Metric.closedBall`, the canonical owner for closed Euclidean balls;
* `Metric.mem_closedBall`, the owner membership criterion for `closedBall`;
* `dist_eq_norm`, the canonical bridge from metric distance to the Euclidean norm;
* `convex_closedBall`, the standard derived convexity API used downstream.

Best owner abstraction:
* `Q₁ : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))`, as the source-facing disk itself.

Primitive data:
* the center `e₁ = (1, 0)`;
* radius `1`.

Derived API:
* the norm-form membership criterion `mem_Q₁_iff`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook disk `Q₁`;
* core/canonical: `Metric.closedBall e₁ 1`;
* bridge/view: `mem_Q₁_iff`.

This file therefore keeps the source-facing owner `Q₁` and reuses the canonical closed-ball API
directly, without a redundant self-equality wrapper around the definition.

/-- Definition 2.29: `Q₁` is the closed Euclidean unit disk in `ℝ²` centered at `e₁ = (1, 0)`.

def Q₁ : Set E :=
  Metric.closedBall e₁ (1 : ℝ)

/-- Membership in `Q₁` is equivalent to the textbook norm inequality `‖x - e₁‖ ≤ 1`. -/
-- Proof sketch: unfold `Q₁`, rewrite membership in the closed ball using
-- `Metric.mem_closedBall`, and then identify the metric distance with the Euclidean norm via
-- `dist_eq_norm`.
