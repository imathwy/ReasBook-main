/- Definition 6.55 lies in the chapter's `WithTop`-valued convex-analysis domain.

Primary domain:
- restricted duality for `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued functions on a real topological module, organized
  around the effective domain and finite real part of the primal function.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `withTopEffectiveDomain` and the notation `dom f` in `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the chapter owner
  for the finite-value domain of a `WithTop ℝ`-valued function;
- `withTopRealPart` in `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the chapter owner for the finite real
  representative extended by `0` off the effective domain;
- `withTopRealPart_eq_untop` in `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the atomic bridge identifying
  `withTopRealPart F x` with the finite value `F x` on `dom F`;
- `mem_withTopEffectiveDomain_iff` in `Chap03/Definition_3_3`, the atomic membership bridge for
  the same owner surface.

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical: `dom F` and `withTopRealPart F`;
- source-facing: the restricted dual maximand and restricted dual function below.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q : Set E`;
- the extended-real-valued function `F : E → WithTop ℝ`;
- the feasible base point `xBar : Q ∩ dom F` for the restricted-dual owner;
- the finite-domain base point `xBar : dom F` for the maximand.

Derived API:
- the restricted dual maximand `s (xBar - x) + F(xBar) - F(x)` on finite points of `F`, read
  through `withTopRealPart F`;
- the restricted dual function as the `sSup` over the nonempty finite feasible set
  `Q ∩ dom F`, witnessed by the chosen base point `xBar`;
- the direct evaluation theorem expanding that supremum.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: `restrictedDualMaximand` and `restrictedDualFunction`;
- core/canonical: `dom F` and `withTopRealPart F`;
- bridge/view: the evaluation theorem `restrictedDualFunction_apply`.

This file reuses the Chapter 3 owner abstraction directly and keeps only the genuinely new
restricted-dual constructions as public declarations. Since the textbook formula reads
`F(xBar) - F(x)`, the source-facing surface below keeps `xBar` and `x` on the finite-value domain
instead of totalizing those terms by the off-domain convention built into `withTopRealPart`. The
restricted-dual owner itself keeps the feasible base-point hypothesis `xBar ∈ Q ∩ dom F`, which
is exactly the data needed to avoid an empty `WithTop ℝ` supremum.

/-- Definition 6.55: the restricted dual function of an `ℝ ∪ {+∞}`-valued function `F` with
respect to `(xBar, Q)` with `xBar ∈ Q ∩ dom F` is the supremum over the finite feasible points
`x ∈ Q ∩ dom F` of the affine gap `s (xBar - x) + F(xBar) - F(x)`. The feasible-base-point
hypothesis keeps the index set nonempty, so this `WithTop ℝ` supremum is mathematically faithful.
In the textbook setting where `Q` is bounded closed convex and the maximum is attained, this
supremum is the displayed maximum. -/
