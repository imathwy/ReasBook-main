/- Definition 6.59 lies in the Chapter 6 composite first-order optimality / linearization-gap
domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `supportFunction` in `Chap03/Definition_3_9`, the chapter owner for extended-real suprema of
  affine functionals over a feasible set;
- `scaledRestrictedDualFunction` in `Chap06/Definition_6_56`, the Chapter 6 owner pattern for a
  source-facing supremum over a feasible set using the set image as the index surface;
- `ConditionalGradientContraction.linearizedCompositeGap` in `Chap06/Theorem_6_14`, the later
  Chapter 6 source-facing extended-valued owner exposing the same linearization-gap pattern with
  an arbitrary model vector.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `linearModelTotalVariation`;
- core/canonical: the same source-facing owner, since no earlier chapter owner directly packages
  this composite linearization gap at a feasible point;
- bridge/view: `linearModelTotalVariation_def`.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q : Set E`;
- the smooth term `f` and regularizer `Ψ`;
- the feasible base point `x : Q`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing owner `linearModelTotalVariation`;
- the textbook notation `δ[Q, f, Ψ](x)`;
- the finite real-part bridge `linearModelTotalVariationReal`;
- the defining expansion theorem `linearModelTotalVariation_def`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the total variation of the linear model at a feasible point;
- core/canonical: the same owner, expressed as an `EReal` supremum over the feasible set;
- bridge/view: `linearModelTotalVariationReal` and the explicit `sSup` expansion below.

This file keeps Definition 6.59 centered on its source-facing owner. The only refinement needed
here is to use the canonical set-image supremum surface instead of subtype-indexed `Set.range`,
which removes unnecessary bookkeeping without changing the mathematics. The real-valued Chapter 6
theorems that consume this quantity should pass through the generic finite-real-part bridge
`linearModelTotalVariationReal` instead of defining parallel real-valued owners.

/-- Definition 6.59: the total variation `δ(x)` of the linear model at a feasible point `x ∈ Q`
is the supremum over feasible points `y ∈ Q` of
`⟪∇ f(x), x - y⟫ + Ψ(x) - Ψ(y)`, recorded in `EReal` so the owner remains faithful even when
the supremum is not bounded above in `ℝ`. In the finite-dimensional setting where this supremum
is finite and attained, this is the textbook maximum. -/
