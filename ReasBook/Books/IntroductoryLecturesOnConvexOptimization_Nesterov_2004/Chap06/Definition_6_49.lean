/- Definition 6.49 lies in the operator-norm / symmetric-matrix spectral-norm domain.

Primary domain:
- operator norms of continuous linear maps into the real symmetric-matrix space `𝕊^n`;
- the ambient matrix spectral norm in the scoped `Matrix.Norms.L2Operator` owner.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm`;
- mathlib `ContinuousLinearMap.sSup_sphere_eq_norm`;
- Chapter 5 `𝕊^n`.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the operator norm of `A : E →L[ℝ] 𝕊^n`, where `E` models the chosen normed
  structure on `ℝ^m`;
- core/canonical: the ambient norm `‖A‖`;
- bridge/view: the unit-sphere spectral-norm formula and, in finite dimensions, existence of a
  maximizing unit vector.

Primitive data:
- a real normed space `E`;
- a continuous linear map `A : E →L[ℝ] 𝕊^n`.

Derived API:
- the canonical operator norm `‖A‖`;
- the source-facing sphere formula in terms of the ambient matrix spectral norm;
- the finite-dimensional attainment statement recovering the textbook maximum.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Definition 6.49 as the operator norm induced by the source norm and the spectral
  norm on symmetric matrices;
- core/canonical: `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm`;
- bridge/view: the symmetric-matrix-to-matrix coercion inside the sphere formula.

/- The canonical owner note for this item: the operator norm induced by the chosen norm on the
source and the spectral norm on `S_n` is the canonical norm on `E →L[ℝ] 𝕊^n`. -/

-- Proof sketch: specialize `ContinuousLinearMap.sSup_sphere_eq_norm` to the symmetric-matrix
-- codomain.
/-- Helper for Definition 6.49: the canonical operator norm of a symmetric-matrix-valued map is
the supremum of `‖A h‖` over the unit sphere of the source space. -/

-- Proof sketch: the unit sphere of a finite-dimensional real normed space is compact, the map
-- `h ↦ ‖((A h : 𝕊^n) : Mat)‖` is continuous, and
-- `operatorNorm_eq_sSup_unitSphere` identifies `‖A‖` with the resulting maximum.
/-- Definition 6.49: in finite dimensions, the operator norm of `A` is attained at some unit
vector of the source space. For the source-faithful maximum formulation, the source space must be
nontrivial so that the unit sphere is nonempty. This recovers the textbook maximum formulation. -/
