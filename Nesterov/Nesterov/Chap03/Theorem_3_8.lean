/- Theorem 3.8 lies in the chapter's `WithTop`-to-`EReal` partial-infimal-projection domain.

Primary mathematical domain:
- constrained fiberwise infima of `WithTop ℝ`-valued convex objectives, expressed on the chapter's
  canonical `EReal` owner.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `partialInfProjection` and `partialInfProjection_convexOn` in `Theorem_3_1_2_3`, the source
  owner and its canonical convexity theorem for real-valued fibers;
- `withTopToEReal`, `dom`, and `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter bridge from
  `WithTop ℝ` data to the owner surface used by convexity statements;
- `extendedRealRealPart` in `Definition_3_1_1_3`, the finite-value bridge on the `EReal` owner;
- mathlib `ConvexOn`, the ambient canonical convexity owner.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the `WithTop` specialization of convexity for the canonical owner
  `partialInfProjection Q (withTopToEReal ∘ φ)`;
- core/canonical: `partialInfProjection_convexOn`;
- bridge/view: restricting the feasible set to `Q ∩ dom φ` and replacing `withTopToEReal ∘ φ` by
  `Real.toEReal ∘ withTopRealPart φ` on that intrinsic finite-value locus.

Primitive data:
- a convex feasible set `Q : Set (X × Y)`;
- a `WithTop ℝ`-valued objective `φ : X × Y → WithTop ℝ`;
- the convexity witness `ConvexOn ℝ (dom φ) (withTopRealPart φ)`.

Derived API:
- the theorem below, transporting the canonical real-valued infimal-projection convexity theorem
  to the chapter's `WithTop` surface.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: Theorem 3.8's `WithTop`-valued partial-infimum convexity statement;
- core/canonical: `partialInfProjection_convexOn`;
- bridge/view: `withTopToEReal`, `withTopRealPart`, and the finite-locus restriction `Q ∩ dom φ`.

The source mathematics adds genuine `WithTop` bridge content, so this file should not collapse to
a pure recall of `partialInfProjection_convexOn`. The refinement instead keeps the source-facing
statement and removes the ad hoc proof gap by proving that points with value `⊤` do not alter the
fiber infimum, so the owner theorem applies directly on the intrinsic finite-value restriction.

/-- Theorem 3.8: if `Q ⊆ X × Y` is convex and `φ : X × Y → ℝ ∪ {+∞}` is convex on its
effective domain, then the constrained partial infimum of the canonical `EReal` view
`withTopToEReal ∘ φ` is convex in the chapter's `EReal` sense. Internally one restricts to
`Q ∩ dom φ` to reuse the real-valued owner theorem, but that restriction is a proof device rather
than a public hypothesis. -/
