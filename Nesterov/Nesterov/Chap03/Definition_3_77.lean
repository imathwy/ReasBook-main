Definition 3.77 is a recall-only item in the chapter's constrained convex-analysis /
relative-subdifferential domain.

Primary domain:
- relative subgradients on a feasible set and the maximum attained by their norms across the two
  functions `f` and `\bar f`.

Relevant owner declarations sampled before refining:
- `subdifferentialWithin` in `Theorem_3_44`, the chapter owner for relative subgradients;
- `mem_subdifferentialWithin_iff` in `Theorem_3_44`, the canonical pointwise membership bridge for
  that owner;
- `Definition_3_70`, where the nearby single-function maximum statement is already written as a
  direct `IsGreatest` proposition on an inlined set of attainable norms;
- `IsGreatest.csSup_eq` in mathlib, the generic bridge from an explicit maximum statement to the
  corresponding `sSup` equality.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the textbook maximum-attainment statement for `M_f`;
- core/canonical: the pointwise owners `∂[Q] f(x)` and `∂[Q] fBar(x)` together with the ambient
  order owner `IsGreatest`;
- bridge/view: none; the one-off set of attainable joint relative-subgradient norms is inlined
  directly into the `IsGreatest` statement.

Primitive data:
- the pointwise relative subdifferentials `∂[Q] f(x)` and `∂[Q] fBar(x)`.

Public derived API:
- none in this recall file.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the textbook maximum-attainment statement for the constant `M_f`;
- core/canonical: `subdifferentialWithin` together with `IsGreatest`;
- bridge/view: the inlined set of attainable norms inside the checked statement.

There is no earlier chapter owner for the whole textbook constant `M_f`, but there is also no
downstream use that justifies a separate public wrapper for the joint norm set. This file
therefore follows the nearby recall-only pattern of `Definition_3_70`: it keeps the source-facing
maximum statement directly as a checked `IsGreatest` proposition on the inlined set of attainable
relative-subgradient norms, and leaves the supremum reformulation to the canonical generic
companion `hM_f.csSup_eq`. Because the checked statement only uses the relative-subdifferential
owner `∂[Q] f(x)` from `Theorem_3_44` and the ambient norm `‖g‖`, its public ambient assumptions
stay on the same seminormed inner-product layer as that owner bridge.

variable (Q : Set E) (f fBar : E → ℝ) (M_f : ℝ)

/- Definition 3.77: the textbook constant `M_f` is the maximum of the norms `‖g‖` of all relative
subgradients `g ∈ ∂_Q f(x) ∪ ∂_Q \bar f(x)` at feasible base points `x`; in Lean this is the
canonical maximum-attainment predicate on the direct set of attainable relative-subgradient norms,
with feasibility carried by `subdifferentialWithin`. -/
