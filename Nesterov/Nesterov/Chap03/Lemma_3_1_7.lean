Lemma 3.1.7 lies in the chapter's extended-valued convex-analysis / subdifferential-calculus
domain on real inner-product spaces.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `withTopEffectiveDomain` in `Definition_3_3`, the chapter owner for the finite-value domain;
- `withTopRealPart` in `Definition_3_3`, the canonical real-valued representative on that domain;
- `ConvexOn ℝ (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)` in `Definition_3_3`, the owner convexity surface;
- `subdifferential` in `Definition_3_1_5`, the owner set-valued subgradient API.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the singleton-subdifferential theorem below;
- core/canonical: `withTopEffectiveDomain`, `withTopRealPart`,
  `ConvexOn ℝ (dom f) (withTopRealPart f)`, and
  `subdifferential`;
- bridge/view: none beyond the theorem statement itself.

Primitive data:
- the ambient `WithTop ℝ`-valued function `f`;
- the base point `x`;
- convexity on the canonical owner surface;
- interior-point membership in the effective domain;
- the primitive gradient witness `HasGradientAt (withTopRealPart f) g x`.

Derived API:
- `subdifferential_eq_singleton_of_hasGradientAt`;
- `subdifferential_eq_singleton_gradient`.

The previous version duplicated the effective-domain, finite-real-part, convexity, and
subdifferential definitions locally. Those notions already have chapter owners upstream, so this
file states the source-facing theorem directly on that owner API instead of maintaining a
parallel wrapper layer. The textbook writes the result on `ℝⁿ`, but the owner declarations used
here only need a complete real inner-product space, and the scalar cannot be weakened away from
`ℝ` because both `gradient` and the chapter subgradient API are formulated through the real inner
product pairing.
