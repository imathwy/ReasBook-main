/- Lemma 3.1.1.2 is a source-facing recall in the chapter's closed-convex `WithTop`-valued
convex-analysis domain.

Primary domain:
- restriction of a closed convex extended-real-valued function to a closed convex subset.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `ClosedConvexOn`
- `ClosedConvexOn.restrict`
- `ClosedConvexOn.isClosed_constrainedEpigraph`
- mathlib `ConvexOn.subset`

Best owner abstraction:
- `ClosedConvexOn`

Primitive data:
- a witness `hf : ClosedConvexOn Q f`
- the subset, closedness, and convexity data for `Q₁ ⊆ Q`

Derived API:
- the canonical owner theorem `ClosedConvexOn.restrict`

Source/core/bridge triage:
- source-facing: the restriction lemma for closed convex functions on a closed convex subset
- core/canonical: `ClosedConvexOn`
- bridge/view: `constrainedEpigraph` together with mathlib `ConvexOn.subset`

The main entry now reuses the owner theorem at the same ambient abstraction level as
`ClosedConvexOn` itself, instead of recalling a later `ℝⁿ`-specialized duplicate. -/
