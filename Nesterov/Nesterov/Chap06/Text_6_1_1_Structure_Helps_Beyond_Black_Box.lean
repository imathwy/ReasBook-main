/- Text 6.1.1 lies in the chapter's surrogate-smoothing / oracle-complexity bridge domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `IsApproximateSolution` in `Chap03/Definition_3_34`, the chapter's source-facing owner for an
  `ε`-accurate unconstrained solution relative to a chosen minimizer `xStar`;
* `isApproximateSolution_iff_isApproximateMinimizer` in `Chap03/Definition_3_34`, the canonical
  bridge from that source-facing owner to the Chapter 1 approximate-minimizer API on
  `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem.unconstrained f`;
* mathlib `IsMinOn`, the canonical owner of exact minimizers on `Set.univ`;
* `fastGradient_oracleComplexity_le_const_div_epsilon_of_smoothApproximation` in
  `Text_6_1_1_Complexity_Insight`, the Chapter 6 owner for the scalar `ε⁻¹` oracle bound.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the statement that a structured smoothing scheme yields a genuine Chapter 3
  `IsApproximateSolution f xStar ε x` once `xStar` is fixed as an exact minimizer of `f`, together
  with an explicit oracle bound;
* core/canonical: `IsApproximateSolution`, the surrogate minimizer owner
  `IsMinOn fμ Set.univ xμStar`, and the imported scalar oracle-complexity theorem;
* bridge/view: the transfer from surrogate suboptimality to the raw objective-gap inequality
  `f x - f xStar ≤ ε`, and then from that inequality to the Chapter 3 approximate-solution owner
  via an exact minimizer of `f`.

Primitive data:
* the surrogate minimizer witness `hxμStar : IsMinOn fμ Set.univ xμStar`;
* the lower and upper approximation inequalities relating `f` and `fμ`;
* the surrogate suboptimality estimate at `x`;
* the scale choice `cμ * ε ≤ μ`, the Lipschitz-growth bound `Lμ ≤ CL / μ`, and the input oracle
  estimate.

Derived API:
* the raw suboptimality estimate `f x - f xStar ≤ ε` against an arbitrary comparison point;
* `IsApproximateSolution f xStar ε x` once `xStar` is also assumed to be an exact minimizer of
  `f`;
* the explicit inverse-`ε` oracle bound from the imported scalar owner theorem.

The file therefore stays at the bridge layer: it does not introduce a parallel smoothing package,
and it keeps only the primitive assumptions actually needed to derive the raw suboptimality,
approximate-solution, and complexity conclusions.

-- Proof sketch: compare the original objective and the smoothed surrogate at `x` and at a
-- comparison point `xStar`. The lower approximation bound gives
-- `f x ≤ fμ x + ε / 2`, the surrogate suboptimality gives
-- `fμ x ≤ fμ xμStar + ε / 2`, the minimizer property of `xμStar` and the upper approximation bound
-- give `fμ xμStar ≤ fμ xStar ≤ f xStar`, and rearranging yields the raw objective-gap estimate
-- `f x - f xStar ≤ ε`.
/-- If the smoothed surrogate approximates the original objective within `ε / 2` from below and
never exceeds it, then an `ε / 2`-accurate point for the surrogate relative to an exact smoothed
minimizer has original objective value at most `ε` above any chosen comparison point `xStar`. -/

-- Proof sketch: the approximation assumptions transfer `ε / 2` surrogate accuracy to the Chapter
-- 6 raw objective-gap estimate by `sub_le_epsilon_of_smoothedObjective_suboptimality`. For
-- the oracle bound, combine
-- `Lμ ≤ CL / μ` with the scale choice `μ ≥ cμ * ε` and positivity of `ε` to get
-- `Lμ / (ε / 2) ≤ (2 * CL / cμ) / ε^2`; taking square roots and multiplying by `CF` yields the
-- displayed `1 / ε` estimate.
/-- Text 6.1.1-Structure Helps Beyond Black-Box: once an objective admits a structured smoothing
scheme whose surrogate `f_μ` lies between `f` and `f + ε / 2`, whose gradient Lipschitz constant
satisfies `L_μ ≤ C_L / μ`, and whose smoothing parameter is chosen on the scale `μ ≳ ε`, any
fast-gradient method that solves the surrogate to accuracy `ε / 2` produces a point whose
original objective value is at most `ε` above any chosen comparison point `xStar`, with oracle
complexity bounded by a constant multiple of `ε⁻¹`. -/
