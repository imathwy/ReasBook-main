/- Definition 6.15 lies in the continuous-location / constrained-minimization domain.

Sampled owner declarations:
- `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, the Chapter 1 owner of a feasible set together with a
  real-valued objective;
- `ContinuousLocationWeights`, the chapter owner of the positive masses `m_j`;
- `Metric.closedBall`, the canonical owner of the Euclidean constraint `‖x‖ ≤ r̄`;
- `mem_closedBall_zero_iff`, the canonical bridge from origin-centered closed-ball membership to
  a norm bound.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: the weighted Euclidean location objective together with the radius-constrained
  minimization problem;
- core/canonical: `SetConstrainedMinimizationProblem` and `Metric.closedBall`;
- bridge/view: the objective expansion and the closed-ball membership rewrite
  `‖x‖ ≤ r̄`.

Primitive data:
- the number `p` of demand points and the dimension `n`;
- positive weights `m_j`, packaged as `ContinuousLocationWeights (Fin p)`;
- centers `c_j : ℝ^n`;
- a radius bound `r̄ : ℝ≥0`.

Derived API:
- the source-facing objective `x ↦ ∑ j, m_j ‖x - c_j‖`;
- the constrained minimization problem on the closed Euclidean ball;
- the feasible-set membership view `‖x‖ ≤ r̄`.
