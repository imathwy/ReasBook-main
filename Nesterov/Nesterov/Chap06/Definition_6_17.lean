Definition 6.17 lies in the affine variational-inequality / monotone affine-operator domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
- `AffineMap` in mathlib, the canonical owner of an affine operator together with its linear part;
- `LinearMap.BilinForm.IsNonneg` in mathlib, the canonical positivity owner for the bilinear form
  underlying a map `E →ₗ[ℝ] Dual ℝ E`;
- `PrimalConvexMinimizationProblem` in `Definition_6_4`, the chapter pattern of keeping only
  genuinely primitive feasible-set data public and deriving convenience API separately;
- `LinearEqualityConstrainedConvexProblem` in `Chap03/Definition_3_27`, the project pattern of
  extending an owner abstraction rather than restating equivalent lower-level data.

Best owner abstraction:
- source-facing: `AffineVariationalInequalityProblem E`;
- core/canonical: `AffineMap` for the operator and `BilinForm.IsNonneg` for the positivity of its
  linear part;
- bridge/view: the source-facing pointwise inequality `0 ≤ B.linear h h`, derived from the
  bilinear-form owner field.

Primitive data:
- the feasible set `Q` together with boundedness, closedness, and convexity;
- the affine operator `B : E →ᵃ[ℝ] E⋆`;
- nonnegativity of the bilinear form `B.linear`.

Derived API:
- coercion to the affine operator as a function;
- the source-facing pointwise monotonicity theorem `linear_nonnegative`;
- the solution predicate `IsSolution`.

/-- Definition 6.17: an affine variational inequality problem consists of a bounded closed convex
set `Q ⊆ E` and an affine operator `B : E → E*` whose linear part satisfies
`⟪Bh, h⟫ ≥ 0` for every `h ∈ E`. The textbook item specializes this owner to finite-dimensional
real normed spaces. -/
