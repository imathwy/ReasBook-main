/- Definition 6.1 lies in the chapter's Fenchel-conjugacy domain.

Relevant owner-style declarations sampled before refinement:
- `Dual ℝ E`, the canonical algebraic-dual owner notation for real linear functionals;
- `fenchelDual` in `Chap03/Definition_3_1_2_1`, the source-facing inner-product-space bridge built
  from this owner by evaluation along `innerₗ`;
- `fenchelSmoothApproximation` in `Definition_6_2`, the immediate Chapter 6 downstream owner that
  consumes `fenchelConjugate` directly.

Best owner abstraction:
- core/canonical: `fenchelConjugate`;
- bridge/view: later specializations from `Dual ℝ E` to inner-product or continuous-dual surfaces.

Primitive data:
- `f : E → EReal`.

Derived API:
- `fenchelConjugate_apply`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
- core/canonical: the dual-space Fenchel supremum owner itself.

This file is the owner, not a bridge. The conjugate formula only needs the primitive module
structure needed to evaluate linear functionals, so the old `AddCommGroup` header was stronger
than necessary; the refined owner now lives over `AddCommMonoid E` and leaves stronger ambient
structures to downstream bridge files.
