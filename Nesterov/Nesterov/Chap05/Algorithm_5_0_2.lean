Algorithm 5.0.2 lies in the finite-dimensional linear-system / Cholesky-factorization domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `Matrix.mulVec_mulVec`, the canonical owner for composing matrix-vector actions;
* `Matrix.invertibleTranspose`, the canonical bridge giving an inverse for `Lᵀ` from one for `L`;
* `mul_invOf_self`, the canonical cancellation theorem for an invertible matrix.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: the two-step Cholesky solve for a factorization `A = L Lᵀ`;
* core/canonical: inverse matrices acting on vectors via `mulVec`;
* bridge/view: the theorem below identifying the source-facing solve with the canonical inverse
  expression.

Primitive data:
* a square matrix `L`,
* a right-hand side `b`,
* a factorization `A = L Lᵀ`,
* an explicit witness `hL : Invertible L`.

Derived API:
* the canonical solve vector `⅟(Lᵀ) *ᵥ (⅟L *ᵥ b)`,
* the solve identity `A *ᵥ (⅟(Lᵀ) *ᵥ (⅟L *ᵥ b)) = b`.

The previous file introduced local wrappers `choleskyForwardSolve` and `choleskySolve` around the
canonical inverse-`mulVec` expressions and then proved the final identity through those wrappers.
This refinement deletes that duplicate API and states the algorithm directly on the `Matrix`
owner surface. -/

/-- Algorithm 5.0.2: once an invertible Cholesky factorization `A = L Lᵀ` is fixed, the canonical
two-step solve
`y = ⅟L *ᵥ b`, `x = ⅟(Lᵀ) *ᵥ y`
produces a vector `x` satisfying `Ax = b`. The positive-definite and triangular hypotheses are
the usual existence conditions for such a factorization, but the solve identity itself only uses
the displayed factorization and invertibility of `L`. -/
