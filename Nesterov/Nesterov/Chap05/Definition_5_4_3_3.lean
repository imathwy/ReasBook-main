Definition 5.4.3.3 lies in the Chapter 5 logarithmic-homogeneity / cone-barrier domain.

Sampled owner-style declarations in the same domain:
* mathlib `ConvexCone ℝ E`, the canonical owner for convex cone domains;
* mathlib `ConvexCone.convex`, which derives convexity from that owner instead of storing it as
  parallel data;
* mathlib `ConvexCone.Pointed.of_nonempty_of_isClosed`, which recovers `0 ∈ K` for a closed
  nonempty cone and supports the nonnegative-scalar bridge;
* `IsBarrierFunctionOn` in `Chap01/Definition_1_10_18`, which carries closedness canonically as a
  parent `Fact`;
* `IsSelfConcordantBarrierOnWith` in `Chap05/Definition_5_3_2`, which keeps the source-facing
  owner while shrinking primitive data to the actual mathematical content.

Best owner abstraction:
* source-facing: `IsLogarithmicallyHomogeneousOnWith K ν F`;
* core/canonical ambient owner: `ConvexCone ℝ E`, with closedness carried separately as
  `Fact (IsClosed (K : Set E))`;
* bridge/view: the set-level `isClosed`, `pointed`, and nonnegative-scalar `smul_mem` lemmas.

Primitive data:
* a cone owner `K : ConvexCone ℝ E`;
* closedness of `K`;
* nonempty interior of `K`;
* `C²` regularity of `F` on `interior K`;
* the source-facing logarithmic scaling law on `interior K` for positive real scalars.

Derived API:
* convexity of `K` from `K.convex`;
* origin membership from closedness plus nonempty interior;
* the nonnegative real-scalar cone-closure bridge `smul_mem`.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: logarithmic homogeneity with parameter `ν`;
* core/canonical: `ConvexCone ℝ E` together with the parent closedness assumption;
* bridge/view: the set-level closure/pointedness lemmas.

There is no earlier project or mathlib owner for this full logarithmic-homogeneity notion, so the
file keeps a source-facing owner declaration. The refinement here is therefore not to delete the
owner, but to organize it around the chapter's canonical cone owner and keep only the genuinely
source-facing extra data. -/

/-- Definition 5.4.3.3: a function `F : E → ℝ` is logarithmically homogeneous on a closed convex
cone `K` with nonempty interior and logarithmic homogeneity parameter `ν` when `F` is twice
continuously differentiable on `interior K` and `F (τ • x) = F x - ν log τ` for every
`x ∈ interior K` and every `τ > 0`. The cone structure itself is carried by the canonical owner
`K : ConvexCone ℝ E`, while closedness remains part of the source-facing notion; sign conditions on
`ν` belong to later barrier layers when they are actually needed, not to logarithmic homogeneity
itself. -/
