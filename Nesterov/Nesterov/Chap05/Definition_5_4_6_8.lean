Definition 5.4.6.8 lies in the chapter's Hessian local-norm domain.

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: `sigmaThree F x h`, the local squared norm `σ₃`
* core/canonical: `hessianLocalNorm` / `‖h‖[F; x]`
* bridge/view: the comparison of `sigmaThree` with the raw Hessian quadratic form via
  `hessianLocalNorm_def` together with `Real.sq_sqrt`

Sampled owner declarations:
* `hessian` in `Chap01/Definition_1_4_16`, the intrinsic Hessian operator owner
* `hessianLocalNorm` in `Chap05/Definition_5_1_1`, the chapter owner for the local norm
* `hessianLocalNorm_def` in `Chap05/Definition_5_1_1`, the canonical owner expansion

Best owner abstraction:
* `hessianLocalNorm`

Primitive data:
* a function `F`
* a base point `x`
* a direction `h`

Derived API:
* the local squared norm `sigmaThree F x h = ‖h‖[F; x]^2`
* the bridge back to `inner ℝ h (hessian F x h)` under the standard nonnegativity hypothesis,
  obtained by squaring `hessianLocalNorm_def`

The source-facing name `sigmaThree` therefore remains, but only as a thin view of the chapter
owner `hessianLocalNorm`, not as a second raw Hessian-level owner. -/
