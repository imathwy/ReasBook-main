/- Primary domain: estimating-sequence gap bounds with a quadratically regularized initial model.

Sampled declarations in this domain:
* `estimatingSequence_gap_mem_Icc`
* `quadraticallyRegularizedObjective`
* `quadraticallyRegularizedObjective_apply`
* `IsEstimatingSequence.gap_mem_Icc`

Best owner abstraction for this file:
* source-facing: the recursive scalar sequence `estimatingWeight α`;
* core/canonical: the stagewise gap-control theorem `estimatingSequence_gap_mem_Icc` together with
  the initial quadratic owner `quadraticallyRegularizedObjective`;
* bridge/view: the later packaged API `IsEstimatingSequence.gap_mem_Icc`, which adds the
  asymptotic hypothesis `λ_k → 0` and is therefore stronger than Theorem 2.19 needs, and the
  pointwise formula from `quadraticallyRegularizedObjective_apply`.

Primitive data kept here:
* the recursive weight family `estimatingWeight α`;
* the initial quadratic owner
  `φ 0 = quadraticallyRegularizedObjective (fun _ ↦ f (x 0)) γ0 (x 0)`;
* the canonical function-space affine upper bound `φ k ≤ lineMap f (φ 0) (estimatingWeight α k)`.

Derived API:
* the product formula for the recursive weight family;
* the textbook suboptimality estimate, kept as a thin specialization of the owner gap bound.

The algorithmic owner `OptimalMethodRecurrence.weight` is only a later specialization of the same
recursion to a method object, so it is not the public owner for this source-facing file. -/

/-- Theorem 2.19: if `xₖ`, `φₖ`, and the recursively defined weights
`λ₀ = 1`, `λₖ₊₁ = (1 - αₖ) λₖ` satisfy the estimating-sequence upper-model hypotheses,
`φ₀ = quadraticallyRegularizedObjective (fun _ ↦ f(x₀)) γ₀ x₀`, equivalently
`φ₀(z) = f(x₀) + (γ₀ / 2) ‖z - x₀‖²`, and `xStar` is a minimizer of `f`, then
`f(xₖ) - f(xStar)` is bounded by `λₖ * (f(x₀) - f(xStar) + (γ₀ / 2) ‖x₀ - xStar‖²)`, where
`λₖ = ∏_{i=0}^{k-1} (1 - αᵢ)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use `hφmin k` and `hfx k` to get
-- `f (x k) ≤ φStar k ≤ φ k xStar`. Apply the owner gap theorem
-- `estimatingSequence_gap_mem_Icc` with `λ_k = estimatingWeight α k`, use the function-space upper
-- bound `hφupper`, and then evaluate the owner initial quadratic model from `hφ0` at `xStar`
-- using `quadraticallyRegularizedObjective_apply`. Since `xStar` minimizes `f`, simplify the
-- resulting interval upper endpoint to the displayed bound. The product formula for `λₖ` is
-- provided by `estimatingWeight_eq_prod`.
