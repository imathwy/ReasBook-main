local notation "Q" => reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay

/-!
Proposition 2.18 is source-facing in the convex-geometry domain of coordinate projections of the
owner epigraph `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay` in `ℝ²`.

Sampled owner-style declarations:
* `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`
* `mem_reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay_iff`
* `Prod.snd`
* `Set.mem_image`

Best owner abstraction:
* `reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay : Set (ℝ × ℝ)`

Primitive data:
* the owner set `Q = reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`

Derived API:
* the second-coordinate image `Prod.snd '' Q`
* its source-facing identification with the positive ray `Ioi (0 : ℝ)`

Source/core/bridge triage:
* source-facing: the textbook statement that the attainable second coordinates in `Q` are exactly
  the positive reals
* core/canonical: the owner set `Q = reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay`
* bridge/view: `mem_reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay_iff` and `Set.mem_image`

No parallel local “hyperbola region” set is introduced here; the proposition is phrased directly
as a statement about the owner set. -/

/-- Proposition 2.18: the second-coordinate projection of
`reciprocalEpigraphOnPositiveRay` is exactly the positive real half-line. The textbook region
`{(τ, x) | 0 < τ ∧ x ≥ 1 / τ}` is already represented by this owner set. -/
-- Proof sketch: if `(τ, x)` belongs to the epigraph, then `x ≥ 1 / τ > 0`. Conversely, for
-- `x > 0` the point `(1 / x, x)` lies in the epigraph and projects to `x`.
