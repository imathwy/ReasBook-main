/-- Lemma 1.4.2 (1): the map on fundamental groups induced by the identity map is the identity
homomorphism. -/
-- Proof sketch: every loop class is represented by a loop `p : Path x x`, and both sides send the
-- class of `p` to itself by definition.

/-- Lemma 1.4.2 (2): the map on fundamental groups induced by a composite `q ∘ p` is the
composite of the induced homomorphisms `q_*` and `p_*`. -/
-- Proof sketch: on a representative loop `r : Path x x`, both sides are definitionally the class
-- of the composite path map `(q ∘ p) ∘ r`.
