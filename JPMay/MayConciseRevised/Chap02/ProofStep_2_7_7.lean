/-- ProofStep 2.7.7: for a finite open cover by path-connected open subsets that is closed under
finite intersections and contains the common basepoint `x`, one can choose for each `y : X` a
path from `x` to `y` such that whenever `y ∈ O i`, the chosen path is entirely contained in
`O i`. -/
-- Proof sketch: for each `y`, the family of cover members containing `y` is nonempty by the cover
-- assumption and finite because the cover is finite. Closure under finite intersections therefore
-- produces a member `O j` equal to the intersection of all those cover members. Since `x` belongs
-- to every `O i`, both `x` and `y` lie in `O j`; path connectedness of `O j` gives a path from
-- `x` to `y` inside `O j`, hence inside every cover member containing `y`.
