/-- ProofStep 2.7.2: if an open cover is closed under finite intersections, then the binary
intersection `O i ∩ O j` of any two members is itself another member of the cover. This is the
overlap used in the van Kampen construction to compare the chosen cover elements. -/
-- Proof sketch: apply
-- `TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover.ClosedUnderNonemptyFiniteIntersections` to the nonempty finite set
-- `{i, j}`. The resulting cover element is exactly the binary intersection of the two chosen
-- opens.
