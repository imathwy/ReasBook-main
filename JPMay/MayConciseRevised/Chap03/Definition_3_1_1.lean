universe u

variable {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X]

/- Definition 3.1.1: a space is locally path connected when the canonical predicate
`LocPathConnectedSpace X` holds, equivalently when each point has arbitrarily small neighborhoods
whose points can be joined to the basepoint by paths staying inside a prescribed neighborhood. -/
recall LocPathConnectedSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop

/-- Local path connectedness means that every neighborhood of a point contains a smaller
neighborhood whose points can be joined to the basepoint by a path staying in the original
neighborhood; this witness neighborhood is therefore automatically contained in the original
neighborhood. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the path-connected neighborhood basis from `LocPathConnectedSpace` and the
-- fact that any two points in a path-connected subset are joined by a path inside that subset;
-- conversely, apply the neighborhood criterion to build a basis of path-connected neighborhoods.
