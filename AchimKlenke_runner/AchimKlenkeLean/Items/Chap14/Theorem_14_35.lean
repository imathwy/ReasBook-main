variable [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (Ω i)] [∀ i, StandardBorelSpace (Ω i)]

-- Proof sketch: this source-facing countable-index formulation is the countable specialization of
-- the chapter owner theorem `existsUnique_projectiveLimit_of_isProjectiveMeasureFamily`; the
-- probability-measure clause is then derived canonically from
-- `IsProjectiveLimit.isProbabilityMeasure`.
/-- Theorem 14.35: for a countable family of standard Borel coordinate spaces, every consistent
family of finite-dimensional probability measures extends uniquely to a probability measure on the
full product, equivalently to a projective limit with the prescribed finite-coordinate marginals. -/
