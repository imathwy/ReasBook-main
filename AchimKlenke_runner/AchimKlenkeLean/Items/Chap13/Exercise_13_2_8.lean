/- The first part of Exercise 13.2.8 is that the textbook distance `(13.3)` on `𝓜_1(E)`, which
Exercise 13.2.1 identifies with the Lévy-Prokhorov distance, is a genuine metric on
`ProbabilityMeasure E`. This is the canonical metric-space instance on the type synonym
`LevyProkhorov (ProbabilityMeasure E)`. -/
#check (inferInstance : MetricSpace (LevyProkhorov (ProbabilityMeasure E)))

/- Exercise 13.2.8: after identifying `(13.3)` with the Lévy-Prokhorov distance from Exercise
13.2.1, the induced metric topology on `𝓜_1(E)` is exactly the topology of weak convergence.
This is the canonical theorem `LevyProkhorov.eq_convergenceInDistribution`. -/
recall LevyProkhorov.eq_convergenceInDistribution
