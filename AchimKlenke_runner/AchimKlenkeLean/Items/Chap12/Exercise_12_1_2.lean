-- Proof sketch: take the test functional `φ(x) = x 0` in the permutation-averaging formula for
-- conditional expectation on the `n`-exchangeable sigma-algebra. Then evaluate the resulting
-- average over `S(n)` explicitly: each of the first `n` coordinates appears equally often in the
-- orbit of the first coordinate, so the symmetrized average is the empirical mean of the first
-- `n` entries.
/-- Exercise 12.1.2: for an exchangeable real sequence, the conditional expectation of the first
coordinate with respect to the `n`-exchangeable sigma-algebra is the empirical mean of the first
`n` coordinates; this is the formal content of equation `(12.4)`. -/
