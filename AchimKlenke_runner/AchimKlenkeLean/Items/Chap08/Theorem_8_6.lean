/-- Theorem 8.6: for a countable measurable partition `(B i)`, pairwise disjoint and with union of
probability `1`, the probability of a measurable event `A` is the countable sum of the
conditional probabilities `P[A | B i]` weighted by the probabilities `P (B i)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: first use the full-measure assumption to rewrite `P A` as
-- `P (A ∩ ⋃ i, B i) = P (⋃ i, A ∩ B i)`. Then apply countable additivity to the measurable,
-- pairwise disjoint sets `A ∩ B i`, and finally use `cond_mul_eq_inter` on each summand to
-- identify `P[A | B i] * P (B i)` with `P (A ∩ B i)`.
