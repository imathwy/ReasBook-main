-- Proof sketch: apply the canonical Bayes identity `cond_eq_inv_mul_cond_mul` to the pair of
-- events `A` and `B k`, then rewrite the denominator with the countable law of total probability
-- from Theorem 8.6.
/-- Theorem 8.7: for a countable measurable partition `(B i)` of full `P`-measure and a
measurable event `A`, Bayes' formula expresses `P[B_k | A]` as the normalized term
`P[A | B_k] * P[B_k]` divided by the total-probability sum over the partition. -/
