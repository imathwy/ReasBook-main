/-- Definition 8.24: for an integrable random variable `Y`, a measurable function `φ : E → ℝ` is a
conditional expectation of `Y` given `X = x` if `X` is measurable and `φ` is the factor from
Equation (8.9) for the conditional expectation of `Y` with respect to `σ(X) = mE.comap X`, i.e. if
`P[Y | mE.comap X] = φ ∘ X`. -/

/-- For a measurable random variable `X`, Definition 8.24 is realized by a measurable factor of
the canonical conditional expectation `P[Y | σ(X)]`. -/

/-- Applying Definition 8.24 to the indicator `1_A` factors the canonical conditional-probability
expression `P⟦A | σ(X)⟧` through `X`. When `A` is measurable, this is the conditional probability
of the event `A` given `X = x`. -/
