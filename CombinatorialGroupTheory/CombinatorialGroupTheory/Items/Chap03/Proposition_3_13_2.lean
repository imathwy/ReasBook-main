Primary domain: combinatorial group theory via locally finite locally convex graphs and
vertex-transitive graph automorphism actions.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a locally finite locally convex graph `Γ`, a group `G` acting transitively on
  its vertices by graph automorphisms, and the finite presentability of one vertex stabilizer.
- `core/canonical`: `SimpleGraph`, `SimpleGraph.Iso`, `SimpleGraph.LocallyFinite`,
  `SimpleGraph.dist`, `PseudoMetricSpace`, `IsIsometricSMul`, `MulAction.stabilizer`,
  `MulAction.IsPretransitive`, and `Group.IsFinitelyPresented`.
- `bridge/view`: `SimpleGraph.IsLocallyConvex` below records the source geodesic-ball convexity
  condition, while the induced vertex action from `ρ : G →* (Γ ≃g Γ)` is expressed canonically by
  `MulAction.compHom V ρ` together with the owner subgroup `MulAction.stabilizer`.

Domain sampling:
1. `SimpleGraph` is mathlib's canonical owner for an undirected incidence graph.
2. `SimpleGraph.Iso` is mathlib's owner abstraction for graph automorphisms.
3. `SimpleGraph.LocallyFinite` and `SimpleGraph.dist` are the canonical owners for finite valence
   and graph metric structure.
4. `PseudoMetricSpace` and `IsIsometricSMul` are the canonical owners for the metric and
   isometric-action layers used by Proposition `3-13-1`.
5. `MulAction.compHom`, `MulAction.stabilizer`, and `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` are the canonical
   owners for the induced vertex action, its stabilizer, and the conclusion.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the graph `Γ`, the graph-isomorphism action `ρ`, and the local convexity
  hypothesis on graph balls;
- derived API: connectedness forced by local convexity, the canonical induced action
  `MulAction.compHom V ρ` on vertices, the stabilizer of a chosen vertex for that action, finite
  closed graph balls in the connected case, bounded descending paths in balls, and the graph-metric
  form of Behr's descending-path condition.

-- Proof sketch: in a connected graph every vertex of the closed ball is reachable from the
-- center, so `SimpleGraph.dist` no longer sees the off-component junk value `0`. Induct on the
-- radius: the ball of radius `0` is `{v}`, and a vertex at radius at most `l + 1` is either
-- already in the radius-`l` ball or adjacent to a vertex there. Local finiteness makes the
-- resulting neighbor union finite.
/-- Every closed ball in a connected locally finite graph is finite. -/

-- Proof sketch: choose the geodesic inside the ball from the local-convexity hypothesis. Along a
-- shortest path, each successive step moves to an adjacent vertex and reduces the remaining graph
-- distance to the endpoint by exactly `1`, so this path witnesses condition `(II)` of Proposition
-- `3-13-1` with `k = 1`.

-- Proof sketch: apply Proposition `3-13-1` to the graph metric `Γ.dist`. Local finiteness gives
-- finite closed balls in the connected case, local convexity gives condition `(II)` with `k = 1`,
-- graph automorphisms preserve graph distance, and the transitivity hypothesis is stated for the
-- action induced by `ρ`. The stabilizer hypothesis is exactly the finite presentability of one
-- vertex stabilizer for that induced action.
/-- Proposition 3-13-2: if a locally finite locally convex graph `Γ` admits a vertex-transitive
action of `G` by graph automorphisms, then finite presentability of one vertex stabilizer implies
finite presentability of `G`. The action is given through the canonical owner
`G →* (Γ ≃g Γ)` of graph automorphisms. -/
