Primary domain: combinatorial group theory of staggered presentations and disc diagrams over a
presentation complex.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a staggered presentation relative to a distinguished ordered subset `X₀ ⊆ X`,
  an actual presentation complex `K(X; R)` realized by
  `PresentationComplex.Coordinates K X R`, a singular disc `S : TwoComplex.Subcomplex C`, a
  diagram `φ : S.complex → K`, and a boundary loop `p` whose cyclic path is the boundary data in
  `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc S (cyclicPath p)`.
- `core/canonical`: `GroupPresentation.IsStaggeredPresentation` is the chapter owner for the
  staggered-presentation hypothesis, `PresentationComplex.Coordinates` is the owner for the actual
  presentation complex, `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` from Proposition `3-9-1` is the
  chapter owner for disc diagrams together with explicit boundary cycle data, `TwoComplex.Hom` is
  the owner for the diagram map, and `basisLetterOccurs` is the chapter owner for the source
  phrase “the generator `x` occurs in the boundary word”.
- `bridge/view`: the source-facing loop `p` is tied to the diagram boundary through the owner
  predicate `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc`.

Domain sampling:
1. `GroupPresentation.IsStaggeredPresentation` from Proposition `3-9-5` is the existing chapter
   owner for staggeredness.
2. `PresentationComplex.Coordinates` from Proposition `3-4-3` is the owner abstraction for the
   presentation complex attached to a relator set, so this file should speak directly about
   `K(X; R)` rather than an unrelated `TwoComplex`.
3. `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` from Proposition `3-9-1` is the chapter owner for the
   singular-disc source together with its explicit boundary cycle.
4. `TwoComplex.Hom` from Proposition `3-3-4` is the owner abstraction for a combinatorial diagram
   map into that presentation complex.
5. `basisLetterOccurs` from Proposition `1-7-4` is the chapter owner for the source phrase
   “the generator `x` occurs”.
6. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.pathLabel` and `boundaryLabel` from Proposition `3-5-9` give the
   established owner pattern for reading a signed word from a loop.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the distinguished subset `X₀`, the relator family `r`, the presentation-complex
  coordinates `coords : PresentationComplex.Coordinates K X (Set.range r)`, the singular disc
  `S : TwoComplex.Subcomplex C`, the morphism `φ : S.complex → K`, and the boundary loop `p`
  recorded in `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc S (cyclicPath p)`;
- derived API: which generators of `X` occur on presentation-complex edges, and the boundary word
  read from a chosen loop after applying the diagram map.

-- Proof sketch: the staggered ordering and the disc-diagram topology force an extremal
-- distinguished face to survive on the outer boundary. The chapter owner
-- `TwoComplex.Subcomplex.IsSingularDisc` packages the source disc together with the fact that the
-- chosen loop `p` carries its boundary cycle. Reading the resulting boundary word through
-- `coords.boundaryLabel φ p`, the extremal generator therefore occurs in that canonical word.
/-- Proposition 3-9-6: let `coords : PresentationComplex.Coordinates K X (Set.range r)` realize
the presentation complex of a staggered relator family `r`, let `S` be a singular disc, let
`φ : S.complex → K` be a diagram over that complex, and let `p` be a loop carrying the boundary
cycle of `S`. If `x` is either the greatest or the least distinguished generator from `X₀`
occurring on the edges of `S.complex`, then `x` already occurs in the boundary word read from
`p`. -/
