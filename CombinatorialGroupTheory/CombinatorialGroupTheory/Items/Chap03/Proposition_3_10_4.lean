Primary domain: aspherical presentations and identities among relations.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a finite sequence of conjugates of relators and inverse relators whose total
  product is trivial, the elementary Peiffer moves on such sequences, and the equivalence between
  triviality of all such identities and asphericity of the presentation.
- `core/canonical`: `CayleyComplex.Coordinates` and `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.IsAspherical`
  from Definition `3-10-1` are the owner notions for spherical-diagram asphericity,
  `List (FreeGroup X)` is the owner for finite identities among relations, `IsConj` is the
  canonical owner for conjugacy in the free group, and `Relation.ReflTransGen` is the canonical
  owner for finite chains of elementary moves.
- `bridge/view`: Definitions `3-10-2` and `3-10-3` provide the two oriented adjacent conjugating
  rewrites used in a Peiffer move, while a separate local deletion step records cancellation of an
  adjacent inverse pair.

Domain sampling:
1. `CayleyComplex.Coordinates.IsAspherical` is already the chapter owner for the asphericity side
   of the equivalence, so the main theorem should reuse it directly.
2. `List (FreeGroup X)` is the canonical owner for a finite sequence `(p₁, ..., pₙ)` of
   conjugates.
3. `IsConj` from mathlib is the canonical owner for “is a conjugate of”.
4. `Relation.ReflTransGen` is the canonical closure operator for “obtainable by finitely many
   elementary moves”.
5. `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap` is the chapter owner relation for the adjacent conjugating
   rewrite, and Definitions `3-10-2` and `3-10-3` contribute its two orientations
   `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap π' π` and `List.IsAdjacentConjugatingSwap π π'`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: a relator set `R`, a list `π : List (FreeGroup X)`, the termwise conjugacy
  condition, and the elementary local rewrite steps on `π`;
- derived API: triviality of an identity via finitely many Peiffer reductions and the main
  equivalence with asphericity.

/-- Proposition 3-10-4: the actual Cayley complex `C(X; R)` is aspherical exactly when the
relator family `R` admits no nontrivial identity among relations. -/
-- Proof sketch: build from any identity among relations the spherical diagram obtained by sewing
-- together the corresponding bouquet of relator discs, and conversely decompose any spherical
-- diagram into such a bouquet. The elementary Peiffer moves are precisely the local modifications
-- that preserve the resulting spherical diagram, and trivial identities are exactly those that
-- reduce to the empty diagram.
