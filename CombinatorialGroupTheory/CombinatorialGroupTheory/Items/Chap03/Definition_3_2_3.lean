-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: cyclic permutations of a loop, cyclic paths, reduced paths, and cyclically
-- reduced loops in a `1`-complex.
-- `core/canonical`: `Quiver.Path` is the owner abstraction for finite composable edge sequences,
-- `Quiver.Total` is the owner abstraction for arrows remembered together with their endpoints,
-- and `Cycle.Chain` is the canonical owner predicate for cyclic adjacency on the rotation
-- quotient of total arrows.
-- `bridge/view`: a loop presents a cyclic path by forgetting its basepoint and retaining only its
-- cyclically ordered edge sequence, while path decomposition via `Quiver.Path.comp` expresses the
-- source-facing cyclic-permutation relation on representatives.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `Quiver.Path` is the canonical owner for finite composable paths.
-- 2. `Quiver.Total` is mathlib's canonical type of arrows together with their source and target.
-- 3. `Cycle α` is mathlib's canonical rotation quotient of lists, with `Cycle.Chain` the owner
--    predicate for cyclic adjacency conditions.
-- 4. `Quiver.Path.comp`, together with `List.IsRotated`, is the bridge from a based loop to its
--    intrinsic cyclic edge sequence.
