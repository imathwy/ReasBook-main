Primary domain: finite-index subgroups of `F`-groups and the Section `7` Fuchsian measure.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: an `F`-group `G`, a finite-index subgroup `H ≤ G`, and the textbook quantity
  `μ(G)` attached to an `F`-group in the Fuchsian-complex discussion.
- `core/canonical`: `IsFGroup` from Definition `3-5-3`, `Subgroup.FiniteIndex` and
  `Subgroup.index` from mathlib, and the standard orientable/nonorientable surface presentations
  from Proposition `3-5-4`.
- `bridge/view`: the scalar `μ(G)` is not an earlier chapter owner, so this file keeps only the
  thin bridge from the standard surface-presentation owners in Proposition `3-5-4` to the
  rational value computed from their signatures.

Domain sampling:
1. `IsFGroup` is the existing project owner predicate for the source notion of an `F`-group.
2. `Subgroup.FiniteIndex` and `Subgroup.index` are mathlib's owner API for subgroup index.
3. `FGroupPresentation.orientableStandardRelators` and
   `FGroupPresentation.nonorientableStandardRelators` from Proposition `3-5-4` are the chapter's
   canonical standard-presentation owners for `F`-groups.
4. Finite sums over the torsion exponents naturally live in `ℚ`, so the Section `7` measure is
   recorded as a rational number.

Best owner abstraction: the finite-index proposition should be stated directly over
`Subgroup.FiniteIndex`, `Subgroup.index`, and `FGroupPresentation.IsMeasure`; the source-facing
main equality is the multiplicative relation `μ(H) = index(H) * μ(G)`, while the ratio form is
only a derived companion when `μ(G) ≠ 0`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive data: the subgroup `H` and the standard surface-presentation witnesses for the two
  measure values `μ(G)` and `μ(H)`;
- derived API: the bridge from a standard surface presentation to `IsFGroup`, the source-facing
  multiplicative finite-index formula `μ(H) = index(H) * μ(G)`, and the ratio formula only as the
  nonzero-denominator companion. No extra wrapper structure for finite-index Fuchsian subgroups is
  introduced.

/-- Proposition 3-7-9: if `H` is a finite-index subgroup of the `F`-group `G`, then Proposition
`3-7-4` makes `H` into an `F`-group again, and any Section `7` Fuchsian measures `μ(G)` and
`μ(H)` satisfy the multiplicative index formula `μ(H) = index(H) * μ(G)`. -/
-- Proof sketch: Proposition `3-7-4` gives that a finite-index subgroup of an `F`-group is again
-- an `F`-group. Choose a Fuchsian complex for `G` and the induced Fuchsian complex for `H`; each
-- face of the latter is a union of exactly `index(H)` faces of the former. By the additivity of
-- the associated area measure from Corollary `3-7-6`, the face areas differ by the same factor,
-- and canceling the common factor `2π` gives the stated proportionality between the corresponding
-- Fuchsian measures.
