/- Proposition 1-11-22 is the Section `11` conclusion that the ambient group `G*` splits over the
free quotient `F`, with kernel `N`, so `G*` is a semidirect product of `N` by `F`.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the extension `1 → N → G* → F → 1` and the existence of a homomorphic section
  of the quotient map `G* → F`.
- `core/canonical`: `GroupExtension N GStar F`, `GroupExtension.Splitting`, and the canonical
  semidirect-product equivalence attached to a splitting.
- `bridge/view`: the source-facing right inverse to `rightHom` is packaged as a
  `GroupExtension.Splitting`, from which the canonical semidirect-product equivalence is derived.

Domain sampling:
1. `GroupExtension N GStar F` is mathlib's owner abstraction for the short exact sequence
   `1 → N → G* → F → 1`.
2. `GroupExtension.Splitting` is the canonical owner of a split extension.
3. `IsFreeGroup.of`, `IsFreeGroup.lift`, and `IsFreeGroup.ext_hom` are the owner API for building
   and characterizing homomorphisms out of the free quotient `F`.
4. `GroupExtension.Splitting.semidirectProductMulEquiv` is the canonical decomposition of a split
   extension as a semidirect product.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive data are the extension `S` and the freeness of the quotient `F`; the source-facing
conclusion is that the extension splits, whose canonical owner is `S.Splitting`. The raw
right-inverse equation for `rightHom` and the semidirect-product equivalence are derived API from
that owner. -/

/-- Proposition 1-11-22: if `1 → N → G* → F → 1` is an extension and the quotient `F` is free,
then the extension splits. Equivalently, the quotient map `G* → F` admits a homomorphic section,
and hence `G*` is canonically identified with a semidirect product via
`s.semidirectProductMulEquiv`. -/
