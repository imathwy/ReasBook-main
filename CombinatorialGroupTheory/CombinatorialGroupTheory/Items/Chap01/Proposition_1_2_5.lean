/-- Proposition 1-2-5: if `U` satisfies Nielsen's conditions `(N0)` through `(N2)`, then one can
associate to each `u ∈ U^{±1}` a prefix word `a u` and a nontrivial middle segment `m u` whose
letters survive in reduced products with no adjacent inverse cancellation. -/
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the existence of the prefix and middle-segment functions appearing in the
-- textbook statement.
-- `core/canonical`: the owner abstraction `FreeGroup.IsNReduced` together with the reduced-word
-- API `toWord`.
-- `bridge/view`: the concrete functions `a` and `m` extracted from the Nielsen-reduced hypothesis.
-- Primitive data are only `U` and `hU`; the functions `a` and `m` and their survival properties
-- are derived output, so there is no separate public owner structure here.
-- Proof sketch: define `a u` as the longest initial segment of `u` that cancels in a nontrivial
-- product `v * u` with `v ∈ U^{±1}`. Condition `(N2)` forces the complementary middle segment to
-- be nonempty, and the cancellation pattern for a product with no adjacent inverse cancellation
-- shows that each chosen middle segment survives in the final reduced word. The chosen occurrence
-- is expressed source-faithfully by a list split `w = s ++ u :: t`, rather than raw index
-- arithmetic on `w`.
