-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the textbook filtrations `G_n`, `L_n(G)`, and `D_n(G)`.
-- `core/canonical`: mathlib's owner lower central series `lowerCentralSeries G`, the augmentation
-- ideals of `MonoidAlgebra ℤ G` and `FreeAlgebra ℤ (Fin m)`, together with quotient rings by
-- powers of those ideals and their unit groups.
-- `bridge/view`: the textbook lower central term `G_n` starts with `G_1 = G`, whereas mathlib
-- uses `lowerCentralSeries G 0 = G`; the theorem below therefore uses the Lean index `n` to encode
-- the textbook index `n + 1`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `lowerCentralSeries G` is the canonical descending central series in mathlib.
-- 2. `foxMagnusHom` from Proposition `1-10-1` is the chapter's earlier Magnus owner on a chosen
--    free basis, so this file should only add the source-facing all-representations filtration and
--    not a second basis-packaged Magnus map.
-- 3. `foxTriangularRepresentation` from Definition `1-10-7` is the project owner for the Fox
--    representation viewpoint, confirming that the representation targets here are derived from the
--    augmentation owners rather than primitive public data.
-- 4. `Bialgebra.counitAlgHom` and `FreeAlgebra.algebraMapInv`, together with `RingHom.ker`, are
--    the canonical augmentation owners on the integral group ring and the noncommutative free
--    algebra.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive section-10 data are the augmentation filtrations on the integral group ring and on
-- the noncommutative free algebra; the truncated Magnus targets and the quotient-to-units map
-- defining `dimensionSubgroup G n` are derived quotient owners, and the subgroup
-- `foxMagnusSeries G n` is the derived intersection of the resulting representation kernels on `G`.

/- Proposition 1-10-3: after reindexing the lower central series to match the textbook convention
`G_1 = G`, every group satisfies
`G_{n + 1} ⊆ L_{n + 1}(G) ⊆ D_{n + 1}(G)`. In Lean this is
`lowerCentralSeries G n ≤ foxMagnusSeries G (n + 1)` and
`foxMagnusSeries G (n + 1) ≤ dimensionSubgroup G (n + 1)`.

The atomic inclusions are exposed first as the reusable public API, and the original chained
statement is then recovered as a bundled companion theorem. -/
-- Proof sketch: the first inclusion comes from the standard fact that, after quotienting the
-- target noncommutative Magnus algebra by the `(n + 1)`st augmentation power, every such reduced
-- representation factors through an `n`-step nilpotent quotient, so it kills the `(n + 1)`st
-- textbook lower-central term. For the second inclusion, apply the Magnus/Fox formula `(*)` to
-- compare the augmentation filtration on those truncated Magnus representations with powers of the
-- augmentation ideal in the integral group ring.
/-- Proposition 1-10-3, first inclusion: the `(n + 1)`st textbook lower-central term lies in the
Magnus/Fox filtration term `L_{n + 1}(G)`. -/

    lowerCentralSeries G n ≤ foxMagnusSeries G (n + 1) := sorry

/-- Proposition 1-10-3, second inclusion: the Magnus/Fox filtration term `L_{n + 1}(G)` lies in
the section-10 dimension subgroup `D_{n + 1}(G)`. -/
