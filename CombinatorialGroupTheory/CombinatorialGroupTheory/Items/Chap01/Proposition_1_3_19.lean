variable {F : Type u} [Group F] [IsFreeGroup F]

/-!
Primary domain: finite-index subgroup intersections in torsion-free groups, specialized here to
free groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: fixed subgroups `H K : Subgroup F`, with `H` of finite index and `K ≠ ⊥`.
- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.FiniteIndex`, `Subgroup.finite_iff_finite_and_finiteIndex`, and the
  ambient torsion-free owner `IsMulTorsionFree`.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook phrase “has non-trivial intersection with” is expressed as
  `H ⊓ K ≠ ⊥`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Subgroup.FiniteIndex` in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Index` is the owner predicate for finite index.
2. `Subgroup.instFiniteIndex_subgroupOf` is the canonical finite-index inheritance on
   `H.subgroupOf K`.
3. `Subgroup.finite_iff_finite_and_finiteIndex` is the owner bridge from a finite finite-index
   subgroup to finiteness of the ambient subgroup.
4. Proposition `1-2-18` provides the reused owner instance `IsMulTorsionFree F` for free groups.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the subgroups `H` and `K`, the finite-index structure on `H`, and the
  nontriviality hypothesis `K ≠ ⊥`;
- derived API: finiteness of `K` under the contradiction hypothesis `H ⊓ K = ⊥`, and hence
  triviality of `K` from torsion-freeness.

/-- Proposition 1-3-19: a finite-index subgroup of a free group has nontrivial intersection with
every nontrivial subgroup. -/
-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: fixed subgroups `H K : Subgroup F`, with `H` of finite index and `K ≠ ⊥`.
-- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.FiniteIndex`, `IsMulTorsionFree`, and the subgroup lattice infimum
-- `H ⊓ K`.
-- `bridge/view`: the textbook phrase “has non-trivial intersection with” is expressed as
-- `H ⊓ K ≠ ⊥`.
-- Proof sketch: under the contradiction hypothesis `H ⊓ K = ⊥`, the induced subgroup
-- `H.subgroupOf K` is trivial and hence finite; because it still has finite index in `K`, the
-- subgroup `K` itself is finite. Proposition `1-2-18` supplies torsion-freeness of free groups, so
-- every finite subgroup is trivial, contradicting `K ≠ ⊥`.
