/- Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the Section `11` syllable length on an amalgamated-product element and the
  associated subset `U` of conjugates of elements of syllable length at most `1`.
- `core/canonical`: `Monoid.PushoutI.NormalWord` together with its syllable list and product map,
  and mathlib's conjugacy relation `IsConj`.
- `bridge/view`: a chosen `NormalWord.Transversal φ`, which turns an element of the pushout into a
  concrete normal word via `NormalWord.equiv`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Monoid.PushoutI` is mathlib's owner abstraction for an indexed amalgamated product.
2. `Monoid.PushoutI.NormalWord.Transversal` is the canonical data used to realize normal forms.
3. `Monoid.PushoutI.NormalWord.equiv` gives the normal form attached to a chosen transversal.
4. `Monoid.PushoutI.base` is the canonical embedding of the amalgamated subgroup, so the
   source clause "`u ∈ A`" is represented by membership in `(base φ).range`.
5. `IsConj` is mathlib's canonical owner relation for conjugacy, so the source subset `U` should
   be phrased directly using it instead of a local witness wrapper.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive source data are the pushout diagram `φ`, a chosen transversal `d`, and the canonical
normal word `NormalWord d`; the book's length is the derived list length on that owner, while the
length of an element `u : PushoutI φ` is obtained by transporting `u` through `NormalWord.equiv`.
The subset `U` is then derived canonically from that length together with `IsConj`.
