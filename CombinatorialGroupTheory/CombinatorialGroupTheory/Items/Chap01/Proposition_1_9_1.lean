-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a group `G` equipped with an abstract length function satisfying the textbook
-- axioms `A0` through `A4`.
-- `core/canonical`: `IsFreeGroup G`, `FreeGroup X`, `FreeGroup.norm`, and the canonical free-group
-- basis carried by the generators of `FreeGroup X`.
-- `bridge/view`: `FreeGroup.reducedWordLength`, together with an injective homomorphism
-- `G →* FreeGroup X` whose pullback of that canonical reduced-word length agrees with the given
-- abstract length function on `G`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `IsFreeGroup G` is mathlib's owner abstraction for the conclusion that `G` is a free group.
-- 2. `FreeGroup X` is the canonical target free group in which the source embedding lands.
-- 3. `FreeGroup.norm` is the canonical reduced-word length relative to the standard basis of
--    `FreeGroup X`, while `FreeGroup.reducedWordLength` is the thin owner-level bridge that hides
--    the proof-only `DecidableEq` implementation detail from public theorem surfaces.
-- 4. `IsFreeGroup.toFreeGroup` is the standard bridge from an abstract free group to its canonical
--    free-group model, so the embedding conclusion is stated directly into `FreeGroup X`.

-- Proof sketch: first realize the abstract length function as the restriction of the canonical
-- reduced-word length along the embedding provided by the second clause. The image subgroup of a
-- free group is then free by Nielsen-Schreier, and the injective homomorphism identifies `G`
-- with that free subgroup.

comes from restricting the canonical reduced-word length on some free group `FreeGroup X` to an
injective copy of `G`. -/
-- Proof sketch: use the canonical norm-preserving comparison with `IsFreeGroup.toFreeGroup G`,
-- then forget that this owner free-group model was canonical and package it as the existential
-- source-facing embedding requested by the textbook statement.
