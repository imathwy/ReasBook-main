Primary domain: boundary layers in planar map theory.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the boundary layer of a map is given by its boundary vertices, the geometric
  edges incident with boundary vertices, and its boundary regions.
- `core/canonical`: `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding C 𝔼²` is the owner of the planar map, and
  the existing predicates
  `TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryVertex` / `TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryRegion` from Definition
  `5-2-7` are the canonical boundary-cell predicates.
- `bridge/view`: an unoriented geometric edge is represented by an oriented edge of the
  `1`-skeleton, so incidence with a boundary vertex is expressed by checking whether one of the
  two endpoints of any representative is a boundary vertex.

Domain sampling:
1. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryVertex` from Definition `5-2-7` is the existing owner
   for boundary vertices of a planar map.
2. `TwoComplex.TwoManifoldEmbedding.IsBoundaryRegion` from Definition `5-2-7` is the existing owner
   for boundary regions of a planar map.
3. `OneComplex.GeometricEdge C.skeleton` is the canonical owner for source-level unoriented
   edges, so “incident with a boundary vertex” should be a predicate on geometric edges rather
   than on oriented representatives.
4. `OneComplex.geometricEdgeSetoid` is the quotient relation identifying an oriented edge with
   its inverse, so it is the correct bridge for making endpoint incidence well defined on
   geometric edges.
