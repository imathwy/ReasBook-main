Primary domain: word-level Greendlinger alternatives for classical small-cancellation pairs.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a relator set `R`, its normal closure `N`, a nontrivial element `w ∈ N`, and a
  cyclically reduced conjugate `w*` whose cyclic word either lies in the symmetrized relator
  family `R*` or has a decomposition `u₁ s₁ ⋯ uₙ sₙ` with each `sₖ` an `i(sₖ)`-remnant
  satisfying the displayed curvature inequality.
- `core/canonical`: `FreeGroup X` is the owner for reduced words, `Subgroup.normalClosure R` is
  the owner for `N`, `IsConj` is the owner relation for conjugacy,
  `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced` is the owner predicate for cyclic reduction,
  `GroupPresentation.symmetrizedRelatorFamily` is the owner for the symmetrized relator family,
  and `List.IsSuffix` / `List.IsInfix` are the canonical list owners for contiguous word
  occurrence and the remaining suffix after such an occurrence,
  and
  `FreeGroupBasis.is_j_remnant` is the chapter owner for the remnant condition attached to each
  segment.
- `bridge/view`: the reusable predicate
  `List.HasOrderedDisjointSublists` packages the repeated source pattern of successive disjoint
  ordered subword occurrences by recursively choosing the suffix left after each segment, and
  the reusable predicate
  `FreeGroup.HasGreendlingerRemnantConfiguration R p q` packages the source-facing decomposition
  as a single `Prop`, using only the direct witness data `(uₖ, sₖ, i(sₖ))` for each segment and
  the rational `List.sum` of the corresponding curvature terms.

Domain sampling:
1. `Subgroup.normalClosure R` is the canonical owner for the normal closure `N`.
2. `FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced` and `IsConj` are the owner predicates for the cyclically
   reduced conjugate `w*`.
3. `GroupPresentation.symmetrizedRelatorFamily` from Proposition `3-11-2` is the owner for the
   cyclic-word relator family `R*`.
4. `FreeGroupBasis.is_j_remnant` from Definition `5-4-6` is the chapter owner for the statement
   that a word is an `i(sₖ)`-remnant.
5. `C(p)[basis, R]` and `T(q)[basis, R]` from Definitions `5-2-2` and `5-2-3` are the owner
   hypotheses for the small-cancellation assumptions in the theorem.
6. `List.IsSuffix` and `List.IsInfix` are the canonical list owners for contiguous occurrence,
   and `List.HasOrderedDisjointSublists` is the thin recursive bridge used by the sixth- and
   quarter-group source refinements.

/-- A word `w` has a Greendlinger remnant configuration for the pair `(q, p)` when its reduced
word is an alternating product `u₁ s₁ ⋯ uₙ sₙ`, each `sₖ` is an `i(sₖ)`-remnant with respect to
`R`, and the indices satisfy the displayed curvature inequality
`∑ [p / q + 2 - i(sₖ)] ≥ p`. This is a thin bridge predicate around the direct source witnesses,
not a separate owner structure. -/

-- Proof sketch: choose a cyclically reduced conjugate `w*` of `w` with a minimal
-- relator-conjugate diagram. The hypotheses `C(p)` and `T(q)` together with the allowed pairs
-- `(6, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(3, 6)` convert the boundary-region estimate of Theorem `5-4-5` into
-- the displayed inequality for the boundary remnants of that diagram. Reading the corresponding
-- consecutive boundary segments on the boundary cycle of the diagram gives the owner predicate
-- `w*.HasGreendlingerRemnantConfiguration R p q`. If the diagram has a single region, its
-- cyclically reduced boundary word represents an element of the symmetrized relator family `R*`,
-- so the first alternative should be stated through that cyclic-word owner rather than by the
-- raw membership predicate `w* ∈ R`.
/-- Theorem 5-4-7: if `R` satisfies `C(p)` and `T(q)` for one of the pairs `(q, p) = (6, 3)`,
`(4, 4)`, or `(3, 6)`, then every nontrivial element of the normal closure of `R` has a
cyclically reduced conjugate `w*` whose cyclic word either lies in the symmetrized relator
family `R*` or admits a decomposition `u₁ s₁ ⋯ uₙ sₙ` with each `sₖ` an `i(sₖ)`-remnant and
`∑ [p / q + 2 - i(sₖ)] ≥ p`; this second alternative is recorded through the canonical bridge
predicate `w*.HasGreendlingerRemnantConfiguration R p q` rather than by repeating its witness
data inline. -/
