Primary domain: reduced group-labelled diagrams in small-cancellation theory.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a diagram is reduced when two region boundary cycles sharing an edge cannot
  cancel across that edge.
- `core/canonical`: `GroupDiagram.pathLabel` is the owner for the label of a boundary segment,
  `TwoComplex.BoundaryPath` is the owner API for a boundary cycle based at a chosen vertex, and
  `Quiver.Path.comp` together with `Hom.toPath` is the canonical way to express that based
  boundary path as a common edge followed by the complementary boundary path.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook boundary cycles `e δ₁` and `δ₂ e⁻¹` are represented by based loops
  `⟨a, e.toPath.comp δ₁⟩` and `⟨a, δ₂.comp (Quiver.reverse e).toPath⟩`.

Domain sampling:
1. `GroupDiagram.pathLabel` from Definition `5-1-4` is the canonical label evaluator on boundary
   paths.
2. `TwoComplex.BoundaryPath` from Definition `3-2-4` is the owner for a based representative of
   a face boundary.
3. `Quiver.Path.comp` and `Quiver.Hom.toPath` are the canonical constructors for the source
   boundary decompositions `e δ₁` and `δ₂ e⁻¹`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the underlying labelled diagram and the two boundary decompositions
  through a common oriented edge, packaged through the owner boundary-path API;
- derived API: the source-facing noncancellation statement on the complementary boundary labels.

/-- Definition 5-2-5: a diagram over `F` is reduced when, whenever two face boundary cycles can
be written as `e δ₁` and `δ₂ e⁻¹` for a common oriented edge `e`, the complementary labels
`φ(δ₁)` and `φ(δ₂)` are not inverse to one another. -/
