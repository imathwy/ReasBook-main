Primary domain: subgroup structure of free products with amalgamation and HNN extensions.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a finitely generated subgroup of an amalgamated free product or an HNN
  extension, together with the dichotomy that it either lies in a conjugate of a factor/base or a
  conjugate of it contains a cyclically reduced element of length at least `2`.
- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong` with its factor embeddings `left` and
  `right`, `HNNExtension` with its base embedding `of`, subgroup conjugation via `MulAut.conj •`,
  and the chapter's cyclically reduced word owners
  `Monoid.CoprodI.Word.IsCyclicallyReduced` and
  `HNNExtension.NormalWord.ReducedWord.IsCyclicallyReduced`.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook "cyclically reduced element of length at least two" is rendered by
  the existence of a cyclically reduced reduced word of syllable-list length at least `2` whose
  canonical evaluation lies in a conjugate of the subgroup.

Domain sampling:
1. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong`, together with
   `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong.left`, `right`, and `ofWord`, is the chapter-facing owner for
   free products with amalgamation.
2. `Monoid.CoprodI.Word.IsCyclicallyReduced` from Theorem `4-2-12` is the project owner for
   cyclically reduced source words in an amalgamated product.
3. `HNNExtension.NormalWord.ReducedWord G B A` and `ReducedWord.toHNNExtension` are the source
   owner and evaluation bridge for HNN normal words, while `ReducedWord.IsCyclicallyReduced` from
   Theorem `4-2-8` is the project owner for cyclic reducedness.
4. `MulAut.conj p • K` is the canonical expression for a conjugate subgroup.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive public data are the ambient amalgamated product or HNN extension, the subgroup
`K`, and the finite-generation hypothesis `K.FG`. The conjugate factor/base subgroups and the
existence of a cyclically reduced element are stated directly in terms of the canonical owner-side
embeddings and reduced-word APIs, without introducing any extra package or surrogate notion.

/-- Lemma 4-6-8 (1): a finitely generated subgroup of a nontrivial free product with amalgamation
is either contained in a conjugate of one of the two factor subgroups, or some conjugate of that
subgroup contains a cyclically reduced element represented by a reduced word of length at least
two. -/
-- Proof sketch: induct on the sum of the normal-form lengths of a finite generating set of the
-- subgroup. If every generator has length `1`, the subgroup lies in a conjugate of one factor.
-- Otherwise, after conjugating so that all generators begin and end in the same factor, one
-- shortens the total length by peeling off a common initial syllable. If this reduction process
-- ever fails, a product of two generators yields a cyclically reduced word of length at least `2`
-- inside a conjugate of the subgroup.

conjugate of the embedded base group, or some conjugate of that subgroup contains a cyclically
reduced HNN word with at least two stable-letter syllables. -/
-- Proof sketch: repeat the amalgamated-product induction with Britton normal forms in place of
-- free-product normal forms. If every generator has no stable-letter syllable, the subgroup lies
-- in a conjugate of the base. Otherwise, conjugating by a suitable initial base syllable reduces
-- the total stable-letter length unless one already obtains a cyclically reduced HNN word of
-- length at least `2` in a conjugate of the subgroup.
