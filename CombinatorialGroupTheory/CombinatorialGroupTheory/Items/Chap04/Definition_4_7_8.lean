Primary domain: benign subgroups in the Higman embedding theorem via HNN extensions.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a subgroup `H ≤ G` together with the source condition that the HNN extension
  `G_H`, obtained by adjoining a stable letter centralizing `H`, embeds in a finitely presented
  group.
- `core/canonical`: `HNNExtension G H H (MulEquiv.refl H)` for the ambient HNN extension,
  `Group.IsFinitelyPresented K` for the ambient finite presentability condition, and injective
  homomorphisms from that HNN extension.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook notation `G_H` is the canonical special case of the HNN-extension
  owner where the associated subgroups are both `H` and the gluing isomorphism is `MulEquiv.refl`.

Domain sampling:
1. `HNNExtension G A B φ` is the chapter and mathlib owner abstraction for adjoining a stable
   letter that conjugates `A` onto `B`.
2. `HNNExtension.equiv_eq_conj` and `HNNExtension.equiv_symm_eq_conj` show that in the special
   case `φ = MulEquiv.refl H`, the stable letter centralizes the image of `H`.
3. `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` is mathlib's owner predicate for the finitely presented target.
4. The surrounding chapter states embeddings source-faithfully by quantifying over a homomorphism
   together with `Function.Injective`, rather than by introducing a second wrapper owner.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: only the subgroup `H`;
- derived owner object: the source group `G_H`, used directly as the canonical HNN extension
  `HNNExtension G H H (MulEquiv.refl H)`;
- derived public property: existence of a finitely presented overgroup together with an injective
  homomorphism from `HNNExtension G H H (MulEquiv.refl H)`.

The textbook restricts to finitely generated ambient groups `G`, but that hypothesis does not
enter the canonical owner construction or the definition itself, so it is omitted from the public
API.
