Primary domain: bipolar structures on groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the two poles `E` and `E*`, admissible sector factorizations, and the bipolar
  decomposition of a group into the fixed subgroup piece and four sectors.
- `core/canonical`: the involution on poles is the standard `Star`/`InvolutiveStar` API, and
  disjointness of the sector family is recorded by mathlib's `Pairwise (Disjoint on ...)`.
- `bridge/view`: coercing a `BipolarStructure` to its sector family `Pole → Pole → Set G`, and the
  owner-side irreducibility predicate `B.IsIrreducible g`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Star` and `InvolutiveStar` are mathlib's owner abstractions for a type equipped with an
   involution.
2. `Pairwise (Disjoint on f)` is the canonical mathlib surface for a pairwise disjoint indexed
   family of sets.
3. `BipolarStructure` is the chapter-facing owner abstraction for Definition `4-6-1`.
4. `HasSectorFactorization` is the primitive source-facing predicate recording admissible products
   through a pole sequence, while `B.IsIrreducible g` is its canonical owner-side view.

Primitive vs. derived:
the primitive data are the subgroup piece `F`, the sector family `sector`, and the axioms they
satisfy. The old five-piece indexing wrapper was only bookkeeping for cover/disjointness, so the
owner now stores those axioms directly instead of exposing a second public piece-index type.
The primitive factorization predicate itself only depends on the multiplicative structure, so it is
stated at the weaker `Monoid` level and then reused inside the group-level owner.
In particular, the source nontriviality axiom `EE* ≠ ∅` belongs to the owner itself rather than to
an auxiliary later predicate, while irreducibility is derived from the primitive factorization
predicate and therefore belongs in the owner file rather than a later theorem file.
