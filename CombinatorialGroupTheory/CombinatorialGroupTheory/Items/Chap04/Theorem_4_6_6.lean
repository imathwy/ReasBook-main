Primary domain: subgroup decompositions in free products with amalgamation and HNN extensions.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a subgroup of a two-factor amalgamated product or of an HNN extension whose
  intersections with conjugates of the amalgamated subgroup or of the HNN associated subgroups are
  trivial, and the resulting free-product decomposition of that subgroup.
- `core/canonical`: `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong` and `HNNExtension` are the ambient owners,
  while `IsKuroshFactorDecomposition` is the project owner for the resulting free-product
  decomposition with one distinguished free factor.
- `bridge/view`: the amalgamated-product decomposition is obtained internally by specializing the
  Chapter 1 Kurosh theorem to the canonical two-factor pushout, while the public subgroup factors
  are stated directly as intersections with conjugates of `(left e).range` and `(right e).range`.
  In the HNN case the factors are likewise expressed directly as the corresponding
  `Subgroup.comap` intersections inside `H`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Subgroup.amalgamatedProductAlong e`, together with `left`, `right`, and `base`, is the
   chapter owner for two-factor free products with amalgamation.
2. `HNNExtension G A B φ`, together with `of`, is mathlib's canonical owner for HNN extensions and
   the embedded base group.
3. `IsKuroshFactorDecomposition` and `kuroshFactorFamily` from Proposition `1-11-24` are the
   project's canonical owners for the subgroup free-product decomposition data.
4. `MulAut.conj` and `Subgroup.comap` are the canonical APIs for expressing the subgroup factors
   as actual intersections inside the subgroup `H`; the generic Chapter 1
   `conjugateFactorIntersectionSubgroup` remains only an internal bridge.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive source-facing data: the subgroup `H` and the hypothesis that it is disjoint from every
  conjugate of the amalgamated subgroup or of the embedded HNN associated subgroups;
- derived API: the free subgroup factor, the family of subgroup factors, the free-product
  equivalence, and the identification of each factor with the corresponding conjugate-intersection
  subgroup.

The finite-generation and nontriviality hypotheses from the textbook are omitted below: the
canonical Kurosh/Bass-Serre decomposition statements do not require them.

-- Proof sketch: specialize Proposition `1-11-24` to the canonical two-factor pushout presenting
-- `P`. The resulting Kurosh factors identify with the direct subgroup intersections with
-- conjugates of `(left e).range` and `(right e).range`, viewed as subgroups of `H`, so the
-- theorem surface stays at the owner level `left`/`right` rather than the internal `Bool`-indexed
-- pushout presentation.

/-- Theorem 4-6-6 (2): in an HNN extension, a subgroup that meets every conjugate of the embedded
associated subgroups trivially is a free product of one free factor together with subgroup factors
which are the corresponding conjugate intersections with conjugates of the embedded base subgroup.

-- Proof sketch: let the subgroup act on the Bass-Serre tree of the HNN extension, or equivalently
-- use the bipolar structure from Section `6`. Trivial intersections with conjugates of the base
-- associated subgroups `A` and `B` force the edge stabilizers to be trivial, so the subgroup is
-- the free product of its vertex stabilizers together with a free group. Those vertex stabilizers
-- are exactly the intersections with conjugates of the embedded base subgroup.
