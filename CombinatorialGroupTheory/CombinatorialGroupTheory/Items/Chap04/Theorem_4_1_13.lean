Primary domain: indexed free products of groups and free-group decompositions.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a finitely generated free group `F`, a surjection `φ : F →* CoprodI A`,
  and a decomposition of `F` as an indexed free product of subgroup factors mapping onto the
  canonical factor subgroups.
- `core/canonical`: `IsFreeGroup` for the ambient free-group hypothesis, `CoprodI` with its
  canonical inclusions `CoprodI.of`, and `Subgroup.map` for the image condition.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook equality `F = *ᵢ H i` is expressed by a multiplicative equivalence
  `CoprodI (fun i ↦ H i) ≃* F` whose restriction to each canonical inclusion is the
  corresponding subgroup embedding. Proposition `3-3-7` already states this theorem at the owner
  level used here, so this file should recall that theorem directly rather than restating a local
  copy.

Domain sampling:
1. `CoprodI` is mathlib's owner abstraction for indexed free products.
2. `CoprodI.of` is the canonical factor inclusion, including for subgroup-indexed free products.
3. `CoprodI.lift` is the universal-property owner for maps out of an indexed free product.
4. `exists_freeProduct_subgroup_family_lifting_surjection_to_indexed_freeProduct` from
   Proposition `3-3-7` is the project owner theorem for this finitely generated source-facing
   statement, while
   `Subgroup.map` is the canonical owner for the factor-image condition.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the finitely generated free group `F`, the factor family `A`, and the
  surjection
  `φ : F →* CoprodI A`;
- derived API: the subgroup family `H`, the free-product equivalence onto `F`, the compatibility
  of that equivalence with the canonical inclusions, and the image-identification equalities.

/- Theorem `4-1-13` adds no new owner-level API beyond Proposition `3-3-7`, so this file recalls
that upstream theorem directly instead of restating its interface as a parallel local item. -/
