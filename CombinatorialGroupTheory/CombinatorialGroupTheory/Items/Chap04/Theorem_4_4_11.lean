Primary domain: one-relator groups and Hopfianity for the Baumslag-Solitar group `BS(2,3)`.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the standard endomorphism of `BS(2,3)` written in the textbook letters `b`
  and `t`, with `t` fixed and `b` sent to `b^2`.
- `core/canonical`: the existing project owner `BaumslagSolitar23.Group` from Theorem `2-2-5`,
  mathlib's `PresentedGroup.toGroup`, and the chapter owner predicate `IsHopfian`.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook letters are recovered from the upstream owner by `b := y` and
  `t := x`.

Domain sampling:
1. Theorem `2-2-5` already packages `BS(2,3)` in the owner namespace `BaumslagSolitar23`,
   together with the canonical generator images `x` and `y`.
2. `PresentedGroup.toGroup` and `PresentedGroup.toGroup.of` are the owner APIs for defining an
   endomorphism from generator images and then evaluating it on those generators.
3. `PresentedGroup.one_of_mem` is the canonical relator-triviality lemma, so a separate local
   theorem saying the defining relator becomes `1` would duplicate owner API.
4. `IsHopfian` from Proposition `1-3-5` is the canonical owner predicate for the conclusion that
   `BS(2,3)` is non-Hopfian.

Primitive vs. derived:
the public primitive data are the existing owner group together with its canonical generators `x`
and `y`. The textbook letters `b` and `t` are only a local notation bridge, and the generator
assignment used to build the endomorphism plus its relator check are derived implementation
details, so they remain private. The named endomorphism and its image/surjectivity/noninjectivity
lemmas are the public companion surface; there is no separate existential wrapper API.

/- Source-facing notation: the textbook letters `b` and `t` are just the upstream owner
generators `y` and `x`. They are kept local so the public API stays on the canonical owner
declarations from Theorem `2-2-5`. -/

/-- The standard endomorphism of `BS(2,3)` is surjective. -/
-- Proof sketch: the image contains `t` by `squareEndomorphism_of_t`, and it also contains `b`
-- because the defining relation rewrites `t⁻¹ b^2 t = b^3`, so from the image element `b^2` one
-- recovers `b`. Since `b` and `t` generate the group, the endomorphism is surjective.
