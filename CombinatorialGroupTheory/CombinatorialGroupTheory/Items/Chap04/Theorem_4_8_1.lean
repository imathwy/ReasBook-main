Primary domain: countable-group embedding theorems together with existential closure properties of
groups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the countable embedding theorem together with the chapter definition of an
  algebraically closed group.
- `core/canonical`: `G ∗ FreeGroup ι` for coefficient words, `Monoid.Coprod.lift` for evaluation
  in an overgroup, `Finset` for finite systems, `Countable` for countability, and
  `Function.Injective` on a homomorphism `C →* A` for an embedding.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook finite systems of equations and inequations over `G` are expressed as
  finite `Finset`s of coefficient words in `G ∗ FreeGroup ι`.

Domain sampling:
1. `Countable` is the canonical mathlib owner for countability of a type.
2. A group embedding is canonically represented by a homomorphism together with
   `Function.Injective`, as in earlier embedding theorems in this chapter.
3. `Monoid.Coprod.lift` is the canonical owner for evaluating a coefficient word in a target group
   once coefficient values and variable values are fixed.
4. Theorems `4-3-3`, `4-3-5`, and `4-3-6` in this chapter already use the source-facing
   existential-overgroup pattern, so Theorem `4-8-1` should keep that surface while deriving its
   algebraic-closedness hypothesis from the owner predicate defined here.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data for algebraic closedness: the ambient group `G`, a variable type `ι`, an
  overgroup `H`, an embedding `e : G →* H`, and finite sets of equations and inequations in
  `G ∗ FreeGroup ι`; the finiteness of the system is already carried by the two `Finset`s, so no
  separate finiteness hypothesis on `ι` belongs in the owner field;
- primitive owner-side relation on that data: `IsAlgebraicallyClosedGroup.IsSolution`;
- primitive public data for Theorem `4-8-1`: the ambient overgroup `A` and the embedding
  `f : C →* A`;
- derived public properties: countability of `A`, algebraic closedness of `A`, and injectivity
  of `f`.

/-- Theorem 4-8-1: every countable group can be embedded in a countable algebraically closed
group. -/
-- Proof sketch: enumerate all finite systems of equations and inequations with coefficients in the
-- current countable group, solve each system whenever it is consistent in some extension, and take
-- the union of the resulting countable chain. Iterating that construction yields a countable union
-- in which every finitely consistent coefficient system over the final group already has a
-- solution, giving a countable algebraically closed overgroup of `C`.
