Primary domain: countable-group embedding theorems with simple divisible overgroups.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: a countable group `C`, an embedding of `C` into a countable simple overgroup,
  and the additional textbook condition that every element of the overgroup has roots of all
  positive integer orders.
- `core/canonical`: `Countable` for countability, `IsSimpleGroup` for simplicity,
  `RootableBy G ℕ` for divisibility, and a homomorphism `C →* G` with `Function.Injective` for an
  embedding.
- `bridge/view`: the textbook phrase “divisible group” is represented canonically in this chapter
  by `RootableBy G ℕ`, as recorded in Definition `4-3-4`.

Domain sampling:
1. Definition `4-3-4` identifies `RootableBy G ℕ` as the chapter's owner abstraction for the
   textbook divisibility condition.
2. Theorem `4-3-3` expresses a countable embedding theorem directly via an ambient group witness
   and an injective homomorphism `C →* G`, without introducing a wrapper structure.
3. Theorem `4-3-6` uses the same owner-level theorem shape for simple overgroups, confirming that
   this theorem should stay source-facing while reusing the canonical owners.
4. `IsSimpleGroup` is mathlib's owner predicate for simplicity of a group.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data: the ambient overgroup `G` and the embedding `f : C →* G`;
- supporting owner witness: a `RootableBy G ℕ` structure on `G` for the textbook divisibility
  condition;
- derived public properties: countability of `G`, simplicity of `G`, and injectivity of `f`.

/-- Theorem 4-3-5: every countable group embeds into a countable simple group in which every
element has roots of all positive integer orders. -/
-- Proof sketch: first enlarge `C` to a countable group containing elements of every order, then
-- embed it into a countable group where elements of the same order are conjugate. That conjugacy
-- condition yields simplicity, and the construction also gives `RootableBy G ℕ`.
