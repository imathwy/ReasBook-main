Primary domain: algebraically closed groups and embedding theorems for finitely generated groups
with solvable word problem.

Layer triage:
- `source-facing`: the group-level property that `G` embeds in every algebraically closed group,
  together with the theorem that solvable word problem implies that property.
- `core/canonical`: `IsAlgebraicallyClosedGroup A` from Theorem `4-8-1` is the chapter owner for
  algebraic closedness, `Group.FG` is mathlib's owner for finite generation, and
  `Group.HasSolvableWordProblem` from Theorem `4-4-8` is the project owner for solvability of the
  word problem.
- `bridge/view`: for a fixed ambient group `A`, a group embedding is a homomorphism `G →* A`
  together with `Function.Injective`.

Domain sampling:
1. `IsAlgebraicallyClosedGroup` in `Theorem_4_8_1` is the chapter owner abstraction for the
   finite-system extension property, so this file should reuse it rather than rebuilding a local
   algebraic-system API.
2. The class field `IsAlgebraicallyClosedGroup.exists_solution_of_satisfiable` in
   `Theorem_4_8_1` is the canonical elimination theorem for that owner abstraction.
3. `Group.FG` is mathlib's owner predicate for finite generation.
4. `Group.HasSolvableWordProblem` from Theorem `4-4-8` is the abstract owner for the source
   hypothesis on `G`.

Primitive vs. derived:
- primitive public data here: the source group `G` and the hypothesis `HasSolvableWordProblem G`;
- derived public data: the finite generation of `G`, exposed below as
  `HasSolvableWordProblem.fg`, and for each algebraically closed ambient group `A` an embedding
  witness `f : G →* A` together with its injectivity. Since algebraic closedness is already owned
  by the class `IsAlgebraicallyClosedGroup`, the ambient hypothesis should be carried by an
  instance binder rather than by a separate explicit argument, and the target universe should
  remain arbitrary because the textbook statement ranges over every algebraically closed group; the
  hidden variable universe used by `IsAlgebraicallyClosedGroup` should remain arbitrary as well.

-- Proof sketch: Boone-Higman embeds `G` in a simple subgroup of a finitely presented group.
-- Interpreting the resulting finite presentation over `A` gives a finite coefficient system, and
-- the ambient algebraic-closedness owner from Theorem `4-8-1` realizes that system in `A`.
-- Simplicity then forces the induced map on the simple subgroup, hence on `G`, to be injective.
/-- Theorem 4-8-4: every finitely generated group with solvable word problem embeds in every
algebraically closed group. The finite generation in the source statement is derived by `hG.fg`.
