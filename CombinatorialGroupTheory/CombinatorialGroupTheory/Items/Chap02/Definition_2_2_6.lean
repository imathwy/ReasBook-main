-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: Conway's family of groups `F_n`, given by `n` generators with the cyclic
-- relators `x_i x_{i+1} = x_{i+2}`.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup` is mathlib's owner abstraction for groups given by
-- generators and relators, and `ZMod n` is the clean cyclic indexing type for the generator
-- family.
-- `bridge/view`: the textbook list
-- `x₁ x₂ = x₃, ..., x_{n-1} x_n = x₁, x_n x₁ = x₂`
-- is encoded as the uniform cyclic relator family indexed by `i : ZMod n`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup rels` is the canonical quotient attached to a relator set in the free group.
-- 2. `PresentedGroup.of` supplies the canonical generators in the quotient.
-- 3. `PresentedGroup.one_of_mem` is the owner lemma saying a listed relator becomes trivial in the
--    presented group.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the cyclic relators in the free group; the group `F_n` is the derived
-- canonical quotient by those relators, so no auxiliary wrapper structure is introduced.

-- Proof sketch: `PresentedGroup.one_of_mem` makes the relator word
-- `x_i x_{i+1} x_{i+2}^{-1}` trivial in the quotient, and simplifying that quotient equation
