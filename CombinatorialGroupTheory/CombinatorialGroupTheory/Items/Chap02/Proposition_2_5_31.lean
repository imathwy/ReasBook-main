universe u v w

-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a one-relator group on generators `X` with defining relator `r`, together with
-- the hypothesis that `X` has cardinality at least three.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton r)` for the one-relator owner,
-- `Cardinal.mk X` for the cardinality lower bound, `Subgroup G` for subgroup data, and quotient
-- groups `S ⧸ N`.
-- `bridge/view`: a chosen equivalence `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton r) ≃* G` transports
-- the owner-level `SQ`-universality statement to an arbitrary ambient group `G`.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup (Set.singleton r)` is the chapter's canonical owner for a group with
--    generators `X` and a single defining relator `r`.
-- 2. `Cardinal.mk X` is the universe-stable way to encode “at least three generators”.
-- 3. `Subgroup G` and `S ⧸ N` are the canonical mathlib owners for subgroups and quotient groups.
-- 4. Definition `2-1-1` uses `PresentedGroup R ≃* G` directly as presentation data, so a chosen
--    equivalence belongs at the bridge layer rather than as primitive owner data for this item.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive owner-level data are only the relator `r` and the lower bound on the cardinality
-- of the generator type; `SQ`-universality is the derived property of admitting every countable
-- group as a subquotient, and invariance under multiplicative equivalence supplies the separate
-- bridge theorem for arbitrary isomorphic ambient groups.
