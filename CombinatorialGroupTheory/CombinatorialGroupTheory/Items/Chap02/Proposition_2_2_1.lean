-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: a finite presentation consists of a finite generator type together with a
-- finite relator set, and Tietze transformations are the elementary operations on such data.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup` is the owner object attached to a relator set,
-- `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` is mathlib's owner predicate for the abstract group-level notion,
-- and `Relation.EqvGen` is the canonical owner for equivalence closure of elementary steps.
-- `bridge/view`: the proposition identifies equality up to a finite Tietze sequence on the
-- source-facing data with isomorphism of the associated canonical presented groups.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup rels` is mathlib's canonical group attached to generators and relations.
-- 2. `PresentedGroup.toGroup` and `PresentedGroup.equivPresentedGroup` are the owner transport
--    maps for changing generators and relators while preserving the presented group.
-- 3. `Group.IsFinitelyPresented` is the canonical abstract owner predicate for the existence of a
--    finite presentation.
-- 4. `Relation.EqvGen` is mathlib's canonical equivalence closure for a primitive one-step
--    relation, so a separate inductive closure API is unnecessary here.
-- 5. Definition `2-1-2` in this chapter already identifies "finite presentation" with the
--    primitive owner predicates `Finite X` and `Set.Finite R`, so no parallel wrapper structure
--    is needed here.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive source data are the generator type and relator set together with the owner
-- finiteness predicates `Finite X` and `Set.Finite R`, together with the one-step
-- source-facing Tietze expansion relation; the presented group, the abstract
-- finite-presentation property, and Tietze equivalence are derived owner-side API.

-- Proof sketch: choose an equivalence between the finite generator type `X` and some `Fin n`,
-- transport the relator set `R` across that equivalence using
-- `PresentedGroup.equivPresentedGroup`, and use the finiteness of the transported relator set to
-- instantiate `Group.IsFinitelyPresented`.

-- Proof sketch: each elementary Tietze expansion preserves the associated presented group up to a
-- canonical multiplicative equivalence, so a finite sequence gives an isomorphism by composition.
-- Conversely, given an isomorphism between the groups defined by two finite presentations, pass to
-- a common presentation on the disjoint union of the generator sets, adjoin the finite defining
-- relators coming from the chosen words on each side, and realize each enlargement as a finite
-- Tietze sequence.

related by a finite sequence of Tietze transformations. -/
