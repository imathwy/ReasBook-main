-- Layer triage:
-- `source-facing`: the cyclically indexed presentation `F_{r,n}` with `n` generators and the
-- relators `x_i x_{i+1} ... x_{i+r-1} = x_{i+r}`.
-- `core/canonical`: `PresentedGroup` is mathlib's owner abstraction for a group given by
-- generators and relators, and `ZMod n` is the canonical cyclic index type.
-- `bridge/view`: the displayed cyclic list of relators is encoded uniformly by a relator family
-- indexed by `i : ZMod n`, using a list product for the left-hand side word.
-- Domain sampling:
-- 1. `PresentedGroup rels` is the canonical group attached to a relator set in `FreeGroup`.
-- 2. `PresentedGroup.mk` and `PresentedGroup.one_of_mem` express that listed relators become
--    trivial in the quotient.
-- 3. `Conway.F` from the previous item is the `r = 2` specialization of the same owner-side
--    presentation pattern, so the generalized file should bridge back to it explicitly.
-- Primitive vs. derived:
-- the primitive data are the cyclic relator words indexed by `r : ℕ`; positivity of `r` is not
-- part of the canonical construction, while the group `F_{r,n}` is the derived quotient by those
-- relators, so no auxiliary package around the presentation is introduced.
